My wife was literally gagging trying to choke down her food and ended up just eating the soft, moist toast.  I'm a bigger eater than her, and even I was having trouble.  Just disgusting.\n\nThe food on my plane ride here was much better.  If  you're trying to decide between the two, go for McDonald's.",

  "text": "I don't know what caused me to think of reviewing this place now.  I joined Yelp several months ago, and dined here back in what must have been September 2007.  \n\nI guess that fact is I still remember this experience vividly.  \n\nEver stay at the MGM and have to spend an entire night vomiting in / sitting on the toilet in your hotel room?  Well, I have.  And the only thing I had to eat that day?  A hot dog and cheese fries from Nathan's at the MGM.  \n\nAll food poisoning aside, the food still tasted like shit.  I don't see how anyone has ever eaten one of those hot dogs and thought \"this tastes good!\".  Those are probably the same people eating at a McDonald's every day, and the ones that build the hype machine around Nathan's annual 4th of July cattle call on Coney Island.  \n\nAnd the employees that worked here were FAR less than enthused about their career path.  Out of the group of six people I was with, I was the only one to eat at Nathan's.  The rest of the group, all five of them, got their food before me.  I think it had something to do with the cheese sauce they put on my fries, which unbeknownst to me at the time, would likely be the cause of my food poisoning later.  Anyway, if I worked here I would seriously contemplate self immolation or starting up a promising career in the drug game (Las Vegas is a great place for drugs, I hear).  \n\nI guess the one positive out of this is my friends get to tell the story of me running for a trash can in hotel room and vomiting into it in the hallway, as our bathroom was being occupied by a female at the time.  That and I didn't vomit on my flight back to St. Louis the next day.",

Grocery Nathan's on the grill taste delish, especially on sale, but it can't quite replicate the yum factor of getting the real thing.\n\nUnfortunately, the Vegas version isn't close to the real thing either, especially since they don't offer the vaunted \"onion sauce\" that makes a New York dog a NEW YORK DOG. (Don't worry, sauerkraut and dijon mustard still available)\n\n$5 for a single hot dog is highway robbery; 2 for $10 gets you fries on the side. Breakfast menu is available but you might as well get that at the MDonald's next door.",

  "text": "So disappointing...  I was at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas over the weekend and made a trip to the food court.  It was right between breakfast/lunch switch.  I got in line for the breakfast waffle bar at Nathan's Hotdogs.  I was approached by what seemed to be a shift leader or manager in a white shirt.  She told me that she had to cut the breakfast line and that I could start a lunch line if I wanted lunch.  I totally understood, told her no worries and was first in the lunch line.  Several groups of people got behind me.  What happened next was very frustrating.  A young woman walked up and she didn't ask her to move.  I waited to make sure she was going to be served breakfast.  Once she was allowed to order a waffle I walked up to the manager and said that this was not right.  Myself along with 3 or 4 other people were refused breakfast but she let this woman order.  She then spoke to the other woman in Spanish, which I do not understand.  To add injury to insult they tried to tell me she phoned in an order.  Which was a lie; we all saw her order the waffle.  2 other people also started to complain that she too should have been turned away.  One gentleman asked to speak to her supervisor.  The supervisor just stood there like we were wasting his time.  After the gentleman explained this incident, the supervisor said Thank You, turned and walked in the back.   I have always been a Nathan's fan but myself and the customers that witnessed this behavior got out of line and  went to McDonald's next store and I vowed to never again purchase a Nathan's product if this is the way they value their customers.",

Though we gravitated towards the familiar McDonald's for a sandwich, Nathan's line was shorter, so we decided to try them out.\n\nI got the Sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin, add bacon the first morning. I figured they would just add bacon to the sandwich, but they gave me a good amount on the side. I think like 5 strips. I believe it was an extra $2 to add bacon, so the amount justified the cost. The second morning, I got the same sandwich without adding bacon. I believe the sandwich was over $5, but less than $6. I can't really remember as I didn't document any of these meals. Both days, the sandwiches hit the spot! I liked that the cheese was melted on the egg and not all over the muffin as I could just eat the inside of the sandwich if I wasn't super hungry.\n\nNathan's offered a great alternative to McDonald's sausage egg mcmuffin. Plus, we didn't have to wait in their ridiculously long line!",

I don't think I'll be going back out there anytime soon so in the meantime, these dogs will have to do.\n\nWe've come back here several times to get snacks whether it be an early or a late snack there is always a line at this location. I guess if you're staying in the hotel then it just makes sense to go to this place.\n\nI agree that the buns aren't so great and if the dogs were thicker it would be even better. However, nothing comes close to the snap of the Nathan's hot dogs and even though most of the time I try to resist these dogs so I can eat somewhere else, I end up having a bite or two of the dog. Their fries are seriously addictive, but I must say, it's damn expensive for what you get.\n\n3.5 stars",

Eggs were moist & fluffy and I loved that they added country gravy on top of my eggs without charging extra. Nice! Gravy great flavor, the bacon I prefer crispy and it wasn't but was still warm and good. Sausage was hot and had good flavor. Preparation area seamed clean, servers were friendly and attentive to what you wanted. Note, they have hot sauce if you need it. Fourth day at MGM best breakfast so far, two more days and two more places to try.",

Let me remind you I'm not picky, it was just that bad!  The hot dog, the runny cheese even the bacon!  I thought I could just pick off the bacon but that too was apparently fried in the same vat.

It's actually an interesting place for a foodcourt, considering Craftsteak and SeaBlue (by Michael Mina) are practically right next door.\n\nI got the 2 hot dog and fries combo for $8.95.  The staff seemed friendly enough.  I didn't have any problems.\n\nThe hot dogs are just.  I guess you can say it's like how people go gaga over Pink's for no good reason because let's face it, Pink's isn't even really that good.  You go really only for the experience of eating at a Los Angeles institution.  I feel the same way with Nathan's.  It's such a historic New York tradition that when someone says \"I want to go try Nathan's\" not because it's THAT good, but because it's a cultural experience.  That's my two cents anyway.\n\nI would however have to say that the hotdog skin has nice pop.  You know what I mean?  No?  Amateurs....\n\nI probably wouldn't come back though.",

  "text": "Despite nothing wrong with this location, I don't really know why anyone would stop by here unless you are about to hit the MGM pool and want something quick and fast.\n\nWhy do I choose to keep coming here?  Mainly because the line is not too long and the food comes out fairly quick. Located in the busy MGM food court, Nathan's Famous is one of the chains that can be frequently found throughout the Las Vegas strip.  With other viable options here, the food here is simply not up to snuff to warrant the high cost of the mediocre product that comes out.  \n\nHere is what I have ordered:\nChargrilled Chicken Sandwich- Everytime I have ordered this the chicken has been lukewarm and underseasoned.  I also found the bun preparation inconsistent.  Sometimes it came out a little warm and other times there was a char on the bottom.  I say go for this item if you must get something with chicken, but it has never been fully satisfying.\n\nSausage, egg, and cheese sandwich - An okay breakfast sandwich.  I did enjoy that the English muffin was toasted nice to get that nice crunch and the cheese melted nice and evenly with the egg.  However, the size was on the smaller side making it not very satisfying.\n\nPerhaps because I have not actually ordered the hot dogs which Nathan's is well known for I am not giving them a fair assessment of their product.  However, I do believe if you are not able to produce a similar quality product on your other items you are better off not serving the item.\n\nOverall, the food here at Nathan's is nothing to be excited about and definitely should not be your go to place at the MGM food court which already has so many other options.",

It came out to almost $12....WOW....expensive for simple hot dogs, but it was decent filler food.  I actually thought the prices are actually reasonable due to the close proximity to the MGM Grand Convention Center and of course the area is a tourist trap.\n\nThree stars is a decent rating for what I needed this restaurant for...maybe this review is more for the MGM Grand Food Court for the convenience to the convention attendees like myself.",

Still, whenever I stay at the MGM, I tend to find myself here at least once scarfing down a dog.\n\nCan't really complain too much about the food court stand.  Everything for the most part is cooked when you order it.  The fries and rings are always hot and crispy.  The Cheese-steaks are decent as well.  Still tastes a bit off from what I remember back east, however it still provides the same artery clogging affects.",

  "text": "I refused to give my business to this establishment a few years back when I repeatedly received VERY poor customer service (I know it's \"fast food,\" but the McDonald's next door is 10x better).  They have messed up my order or completely FORGOTTEN to make my order many times.  Really disappointing.\n\nWell, for some reason tonight I decided to give it another try.  The cashier was semi-friendly, took my order and gave me the little vibrating number holder.  I ordered the chicken finger platter....I know that they make these fresh, but it took a looooong time.  Other customers came and went with their food and I still stood there, waiting.  Finally, after 15 minutes, they were ready.  I ordered (and paid for) a side of the cheese sauce, along with hot sauce and ranch.  None of that was in my bag when she gave me my order.  When I asked for them, she made a loud sigh and proceeded to get the items I requested.\n\nThe food itself was good and fresh.  The chicken fingers were crispy and light and the fries were good as well.\n\nI am borderline 3 stars for this place.  Unfortunately, the prices are enough to bring me back to 2 stars.  I understand that it's the strip, but the McDonald's next door has similar prices to what you would find anywhere.  $11.95 for a chicken caesar salad is a bit ridiculous.  And if they were nice, I could even look past that....But rudeness and lack of attention to detail will bump you down every time.  Sorry 'bout it!",

I thought it was a very good hot dog. The service isn't always the fastest, but that can be expected for a busy place like the MGM food court. Also, $6 is a bit pricey for a hot dog, but again it's the MGM food court. All things considered, it's not a bad option.",

  "text": "We wanted something \"light\" for dinner.  With 5 fast food restaurants in the food court there wasn't a large selection to have a lighter meal.  So we had salads at Nathan's.  Given that Nathan's is a hot dog joint, the salads were surprisingly good and hit the spot.\n\nThe process is to order then they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready.  I guess it comes in handy if it gets really crowded but it wasn't so that seemed like a waste of time.\n\nThe bacon cheese fries were also good (OK, so I didn't entirely go light) but the bacon was overly smokey tasting.  Next time it will be cheese only.\n\nOverall not a bad choice given the selection of restaurants in the food court.",

It was everything I was hoping it to be specially after hours of partying hahah. \n\nIt was a huge portion with tons of meat mixed with saut\u00e9ed onions, green peppers, mushrooms and of course plenty of fatty bacon. \n\nThe bread was lightly toasted with butter and it was crispy from the outside and nice and fluffy from the inside. \n\nYou can get the nacho cheese included or as I prefer on the side. It's about $12-15 per person including a drink. Next time I will be trying the famous hot dogs hopefully there good too.",

The buzzer thingies didn't even match the recipes!  While we were standing there, there was a couple that said they had been waiting for almost 30 minutes and one of the workers gave their food to someone else.  If I knew it took that long to get fast food, I woulda called ahead for reservations.",

That said the price at Nathan's is not cheap,  it pars at the same price at a concession stand at an event center if not higher. I had the foot long chilli dog, (get your mind out of the gutter). And chiili fries. My drink was over filled with ice took 4 zips and hello? Where is my soda? Chilli fries was delicious and the foot long was not warm. there are other choices at roughly the same pricing move on.",

This is fast food:  Nothing fancy and the people behind the counter don't give a shit about you so you have to speak up when you order.  That's really the bottom line.  I had the sausage, egg and cheese muffin two mornings in a row along with a hashbrown.  Other than trying to hustle drinks on you, I'd say this is a really good place to eat.  Your other choices are McDonald's (for the price conscience), or the pizza place.  I forgot the other place to the left of Nathan's.  This is a great place for breakfast.

But if you just want a chili cheese fry and a hot dog with relish, ketchup, mustard and onions, Nathan's at MGM is sufficient. The food was fast food good. But they did mess up the order which should have added chili and cheese to the dogs.  Mind you, I'm a burger and fry freak who does triathlons at the Iron distance so I don't take my cheat meals lightly. And I was more than happy to gobble down this hot mess before moving on to the next adventure.",
