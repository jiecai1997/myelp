We decided to dine-in.\n\nWe ordered egg rolls, I had the kung pao shrimp lunch special, and the husband had sesame chicken lunch special (for the lunch special you get fried rice, lo mein and a drink).  \n\nTo be honest the place looked like a dump. The walls were covered with food stains of some sort (looks like boogers). The chairs wobbles and the tables were chipped. Looks old and worn down. (if only I had seen all this before our food arrived) We were kind of worried that we might get food poisoning, but we took the risk. \n\nThe eggs rolls were okay, nice and hot, crispy on the outside, but for my taste very bland. The kung pao shrimp was okay, I expected to have more shrimp, but their were only about 6, their was some nice flavors. The rice and lo mein were also bland. They had some onions in the lo mein that tasted awful, which made the whole lo mein taste bad. The lo mein tasted so bad that I had to spit it out (I think the onions were old).\n\nThe sesame chicken was good. It was crispy on the outside and you get a whole bunch compared to the kung pao shrimp. Their was tons of sauce with the sesame chicken, no complaints there. But the husband did agree that the lo mein was pretty awful. \n\nThe service was good. The lady who took our order was friendly. Our food came out less than 10-15 minutes. \n\nThe question is, would we come back here again? No. Would we recommend the place? No.", "business_id": "KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-09", "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng", "review_id": "Ra_IaHjXCE49UWL_eXOy9Q", "text": "I was super excited when I saw that this restaurant was going to open, as it's right next to where I live. I love Italian Beef & Italian sausage sandwiches. I'm down to try any Chicago style places. \n\nFirst time I went I got the spicy joe's sandwich, which is their version of Italian Beef with gardinier. It was served open face, and had plenty of gardinier on it. The one thing that I didn't like about it was that it was dry. I like my sandwiches dripping with the sauce. But, the flavor was good and the meat moist. \n\nThe second time I got the combo, which came with italian Sausage and beef. Beef was the same as last time, but the sausage definitely wasn't what I was expecting. It was a home made patty, but I had been looking forward to a traditional sausage. They had covered in marinara sauce, which i wouldn't have minded but the marinara sauce was super salty.\n\nService is good. The waitress was the same both times I went, and she was friendly. \n\nAlthough the food is only OK, it's the only place near me to get Chicago style food. So, I'll keep going back... when I'm really really really really craving my italian beefs.", "business_id": "wlY7T5ue3lL8Hcf1r_Ts2A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-04-18", "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw", "review_id": "kjOQ6JiThWq5uThY01w18A", "text": "Giovanni's is back!

I assumed these dishes were the chef's specialties, due to the name of the plate, but apparently the chef took the night off.  The relleno was a combo of dry chicken inside a dry coating that tasted like a dry biscuit with no cheese and very little sauce which was also bland. The seafood enchilada was supposed to have shrimp, crab and orange roughy, but it only had shrimp and was boooooring with very little sauce and no cheese. The carnitas taco was the least offensive, but the carnitas was also very dry and didn't have much flavor on its own. The rice and beans were bland and boring. I didn't realize that Mexican food could get this dull. I even had to ask for more salsa so I could counteract the dryness enough to get the food down.

The pizza is really good as well.  We have tried the cheese pizza (which is a great deal, a large cheese for $8!  Cheaper than Walmart!) and the Rustica Pizza (roasted red peppers, chicken, artichokes).  The delivery was fast, it only took them like 30 minutes when they told me 45.\n\nToday we actually went in to eat.

We were all happy with the food.  \n\nThe salads were a good size portion and you could probably spit them between two people.  I LOVED the Caesar salad because the dressing was homemade, therefore it was REAL Caesar dressing.  You could taste the garlic and it had just a hint of anchovy flavor, totally brought me back to my childhood.  The house salad was a mixed green salad with some tomatoes and balsamic vinegar (for only $3, I think that is cheaper than Mickey Ds) and my mom really liked it.  The salads came with these yummy homemade rolls that were hot out of the oven.  The Penne a la vodka was delicous, very creamy and tasty and there was so much of it, I will be having it for dinner later tonight.  The chicken sorrentino was also a good size portion chicken breast served on top of linguine, my mom took half of hers home.  The sandwiches were a decent size and my dad (I consider him an expert in sausage and peppers since it is one of his signature dishes), really enjoyed the sandwich.  The sandwiches came with crinkle cut fries, which is a score in my book cause I hate skinny fries.  Oh and the cool thing was that the owner was doing everything himself.

I recently found a great Cuban one in the Northwest called Varadero that needs our support as the strip mall it's in isn't what you'd call bustling.\n\nIt's hard to find good Cuban food in Vegas, and sadly we've lost a few of the better Cuban restaurants to the recession. I generally go to Havana Cafe on Eastern, but as much as I enjoy it I can't really say it's frugal. Varadero is frugal, however, and the food is just as good, if not better.\n\nI'm itching to try more on the menu because both times I've gone everything has been just delicious. The traditional black bean soup is well done ($2.25), but a more interesting soup is the Crema Aurora, a cream based tomato and cheese concoction ($2.95). The heavy \"soup\" is actually more reminiscent of a dip, which paired wonderfully with the complimentary toasted Cuban garlic bread.\n\nThe Ropa Vieja ($10.75), meaning \"torn clothes,\" was better than any I can remember having had. The rich, tomato based broth was reduced to perfect gravy consistency, and the shredded beef was tender without being mushy. Another highlight was the Arroz con Pollo ($10.95). It consisted of a juicy roasted half chicken hidden under a bed of creamy, saffron colored Cuban risotto. Both entrees came with maduros, or sweet fried plantains, and moros y cristianos, black beans and white rice cooked together. The latter wasn't done as well as at Havana Cafe but the maduros were as good as you can get.\n\nFor the prices and food quality you can't beat Varadero for Cuban food. It's one of the few good non-chains in the Northwest.

I'm not usually a fan of all-you-can-eat since I usually end up spending more than I consume, but this is a good one. For eight bones, you cant go wrong.\n\nSelections included; shrimp ceviche; mole; chile verde; hominy soup; and cheesy roasted potato skins, amongst a handful of other more ordinary dishes. Everything was much better than I had expected. The ceviche was full of avocado and wonderfully fresh shrimp and the mole was fall-apart tender. The pork chile verde was probably my favorite.\n\nDessert wasn't as impressive as the flan was mediocre at best. There was also something that reminded me of a caramel turtle pie. This was good, but so thick and sweet it was like eating candy. Next time I might splurge a little and get the tempting fried ice cream.\n\nEven with a do-it-yourself buffet, the service was attentive and kind.

It was 45 minutes I waited for nearly inedible food. \n45 minutes for takeout is inexcusable and for the food to be awful after that is atrocious.

They asked me how about this place... I was hesitate at first, since I didn't hear much great things, but when my mother told me all my relatives from Korea LOVED this place when they visited Vegas for my cousin's wedding... that changed everything. My mother goes.. have you even tried their food??!! I said Nooo, but heard it wasn't good. Then she goes.. how You know that if you never tried this place yet??!?!! Good point...\n\nThat being said... we went in and the owner recognized my Father. My father goes.. you remember me?? The owner goes... yes of course!!! The story behind this was.. when my relatives from Korea were in town.. they literally came here every single day for two weeks. They Loved their soups and thought it was better than Tofu Hut. The owner even gave my uncle a free bottle of soju when he ate there.. If you don't know about my uncle.. he drinks soju... in the morning, afternoon, evening, and even late night!! It's a Korean tradition back home I swear!!!\n\nWe all ordered their Oxknee Soup.. which is #5 on the top list of food picture you see on the right side when you walk in or in the menu book .. under Soup.. it's #3 called Beef Knee Bone Soup. If you like tendons, the chewy muscles... this will be your favorite soup to have. My parents say this soup is the best from all the others. The broth is milky, beige from all the slow cooking from the bones of the meats. It's so soothing and tasty. I loved it!!! I added tons of sliced green onion and a tablespoon of salt, but you can determine how much you want. The tendons were soft, jelly-like chewy texture... only a few were somewhat firm in chewing. If the pieces are too big to put in your mouth, there's a scissor to cut it in pieces.. which is also used for the two types of kimchi they give you. One is napa cabbage and the other is daikon radish... it comes in two thick dark jars and an endless amount of kimchi to your hearts desire!!! There's a separate dish, where you place the kimchi's to cut into pieces and add to the soup or eat as a condiment. They first bring out six complimentary pieces of deep fried zucchini.. then the kimchi. We were also given a jalapeno, daikon, and diced onion marinated in soy sauce to eat on the side with the soup.\n\nThe daikon radish kimchi was perfectly fermented that it had a great crunch and crisp, fresh taste to it. My mother commented on how good it was. They also give you a sauce to dip the tendons in, which consist of soy sauce and hot mustard.. you mix it together and dip the tendon or should I say coat the tendon in and eat it with the bowl of rice... sip the broth of the soup after and it all goes down so well. Delicious, soothing, and perfect for a cold winter night or day!\n\nThey provide barley tea and at the end.. you get a free cup of cold, refreshing sweet rice drink for dessert. It also helps with digestion my mother pointed out. Great way to wash everything down and even in Winter, it was so invigorating to drink. Loveloveloved it!!! \n\nThis place is right across the street, adjacent to Cafe Moda and in the same complex of 168 Market. It has brown brick walls and a red sign on top of the restaurant. The sign is written in Korean, so don't bother looking for E-Jo at all. They have about eight tables inside and a tv that has some korean drama playing. I didn't think much of this place from the reviews I read, but this place ended up to be such a delightful surprise. They are known for their soups and tasty broth. Service was great and the soup was therapeutic. It stayed hot for a long while, since the pot kept the heat in the soup and even after.. the broth stayed perfectly warm to just sip through. My father told me when you eat this soup, you won't get hungry for a long time. It was very filling, but in a good way. It just relaxes you... I guess you really can't judge a place by a few bad reviews. You need to come here and try it yourself or at least with someone that knows what's good here. I finally did and enjoyed it.", "business_id": "z83HCJLwq6xeohRPYdiebg", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-12-14", "useful": 1, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "Ih5VQu-GpZ3ldm1PEeY0UQ", "review_id": "K2rcxCKv4gn7_0xDG6rI4g", "text": "Will NEVER go there again! The only reason we traveled half way across town to check this place out was because i got a good deal through Groupon and wanted to try the food. Bad idea! Me and my daughter went there for lunch on a Monday afternoon. We were the ONLY ones in the whole place (now I know why!).  When we walked in the place was nothing special and no one greeted us or sat us at a table.  We waited for what seemed like 5 minutes before some guy came out from the kitchen and reluctantly took our order.  We asked him about the lunch special that was clearly posted on the outside window but he had no idea what it included.  \n\nWe should've just left then, but I wanted to use the Groupon that I purchased and would probably not be on this side of town any time soon.  After he took our order, we sat ourselves down and about 5 minutes or so went by before a waitress came out to ask if we needed anything.  She brought us drinks and never came back until the food was done.  Both the appetizer and the main dish were both greasy and bland.  The food was definitely not anything to return for.  We waited and waited for refills on our drinks but the waitress never returned and we had to go get the attention of someone out of the kitchen to get our drinks refilled. \n\nI didn't think things could get worse, but once the bill came they did!  I showed the waitress the Groupon voucher on my phone (like I have been doing at numerous establishments for the past two years) and she had no idea what I was trying to show her.  She immediately got rude with me and asked me \"who sent that to you??\". I tried to explain how Groupon works, since she obviously lives under a rock, but she just acted like I was being ridiculous and giving her some kind of \"fake\" coupon.  When I finally made her understand that my phone was the actual voucher, she was even more rude than before.  Her exact words were \"what am i supposed to do with that?! How am i supposed to scan it??? THIS ISN'T A GROCERY STORE!!\" Wooooow! I couldn't believe my ears. How could she talk to me like that just because SHE didn't know what to do?? Is it my fault she lives in the stone ages and has no clue how to get a coupon off of my phone?!? She just kept telling me that \"they don't use that company any more\" and \"I don't think we can take that\".  She refused to even deal with me and my stupid phone coupon.  I had to pay the entire bill and was unable to use my Groupon.  \n\nThe service was horrible even before I presented the coupon and it got 10 times worse after, I would not recommend this place to anyone! I will contact Groupon tomorrow and get my money back (because THEY have great customer service!) and I WILL NOT BE STEPPING FOOT IN CARMINES EVER AGAIN!", "business_id": "AQKOuwrOCacAhd-jfFMABA", "stars": 1, "date": "2013-11-26", "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "9Rd_P_Ap9uKpNkDxlkosvg", "review_id": "WPorV_EwganH4lbEC5y_kg", "text": "I was told that the Buffet in the Sahara really sucks and we just wanted breakfast that was reasonable and good.

And i'll tell you, they're one of the most pleasant people I have ever met. Hospitable, welcoming and very warm hearted people! Michael greeted me and was very nice to tell me their specials; $3.95 for a slice of cheese pizza and a soda.  I placed my order and started looking around. Their dining area was decorated with dining room tables you'd find at your own home. Very vintage style and I love it! While I was walking around admiring the place, Michael asked me if I ever had \"fried dough with powdered sugar\" I told him no, and he offered me some straight from the container he was giving to his aunt's friend.

A grilled cheese truck?  Isn't grilled cheese one of the first things we all learn to cook ourselves when we're children?  And as we grew up, we threw more than just cheese into our sandwiches?  For me, a grilled cheese sandwich is a clean slate where you open up your cupboards and refrigerator, see what random veggies and meats you have, and throw them into your own creation.  Pickles, chips, bacon, tomato and whatever was laying around and doing a bad job at getting eaten.  Why would I pay someone else to make me a grilled cheese sandwich?\n\nBecause, unlike Muncheeze, I don't have what amounts to Pulled Porky (Slidin' Thru) ingredients in my refrigerator.  That, and my curiosity had to be quenched; this is the sister truck to Slidin' Thru after all.  I ordered $10 The Munchbox Combo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=mpiJd-Oce51nSrAv40SWsw), which includes:\n\n-Any sandwich; I went with the Piggy Mac (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=kzXgIx3n3pYd6YEX23Jobg): pulled pork with jalape\u00f1o, bacon, mac&cheese and BBQ sauce.  Think Pulled Porky slider with mac & cheese.  The one ingredient that fell short of expectations to me was the mac & cheese; it had that re-heated consistency where the macaroni appears to have absorbed the gooey cheese that you have when it is fresh.  I also don't think it's plausible to have a fresh batch of mac & cheese made for each sandwich, though.\n\n-Six Mac Bites (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=YP__n0J35JtAdi4DlcdPOg): Little macaroni & cheese poppers that comes with a \"holla-peno ketchup.\"  It was marinara sauce with a slight zing to it.  The bites themselves (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=VeHYtE8SFymSQHZrRjCKIA) suffered from the same critique I had of the macaroni & cheese in the Piggy Mac.\n\n-A drink; I got a 700ml bottle of water.\n\nIf you go strictly by the menu pricing, the Munchbox combo saves you a dollar: $6 sandwich + $3 Mac Bites + $2 drink.  If you go by execution I think it falls a little short; I was hoping for more cheese!  A gooey Piggy Mac that struggled to stay together because the macaroni was swimming in cheese!  Mac Bites that burned the roof of my mouth with cheesy macaroni!  Maybe I was just a hungry kid that grew up putting way too much kids in my sandwiches.  But that is what I was hoping for.\n\nEither way I will be returning to the truck.  I gotta try the Tomato Soup and Lobster Bisque; maybe even the Chi Chi and Sassperilla.  As for their Piggy Mac?  I'm honestly tempted to take home some Porky sliders and pair it up with some fresh mac & cheese for a homemade Piggy Mac...

I'd be one of the first to say that you're usually not going to find anything truly special on wheels, with a few notable exceptions of course, so I'm not that I'd never heard of them until i saw the lineup of a new weekly food truck event that I was planning to visit. After trying the food, I became very surprised indeed.\n\nThe highlight of their menu of \"Barcelona Inspired Street Food\" (you'll see the words on both sides of the truck) is actually a separate blackboard full of Iberico ham options (Jamon Iberico \"de Bellota\" to boot, which is reputedly the highest qualtiy). The gentleman outside the truck pointed out this menu while I stared pensively at the truck, and the chef went so far as to offer me a sample.\n\nI will admit that I have certainly never had Iberico before, so I have no point of comparison, but the morsel of meat that the chef offered me was the best thinly sliced ham that I have ever had the pleasure to taste - far richer than whatever prosciuttos that I've eaten (laugh at me all you want, but I'm not that well-traveled or experienced). Consequently, I had to order off their Iberico menu, whether or not the pig that this came from actually ingested acorns and only acorns all of its life.\n\nI chose the Flat Bread of Iberico ($12), which was simply the ham draped on a flatbread, with some tomato and olive oil in between. I already waxed poetic about the ham, but the bread was surprisingly good, certainly far better than whatever run-of-the-mill pitas that every Greek place uses. The tomato was a welcome acidic accent, but perhaps slightly overpowering in some bites. Still, I'd definitely suggest ponying up for either this or really any of their other options if they offer what they call Iberico.\n\nI was also hungry enough to order the Barcelona Sausage ($8.50), a non-encased pork sausage in a buttery roll with zucchini sprouts and chimichurri mojo verde. I really have to highlight the awesome roll, which is by far the best bread that I've had from a food truck and certainly one of the better ones if I include brick-and-mortar. They actually source it from local outfit Great Buns Bakery, but whether it's the third-party softness and airiness or the chef's grill treatment, you can't miss their bocatas (aka bocadillos, aka sandwiches) for this reason alone.\n\nThe sausage needed to shine too - heck, it's the namesake - and it indeed had a rich, meaty flavor. It kinda reminded me a bit of bratwurst, actually. The accompaniments are also nice, including some chips (taro?) that were somewhat prone to falling off but still delivered a touch of crunchiness. I'll likely also grab another bocata next time to see what else they have to offer.\n\nBy the way, both portion sizes are what I'd charmingly call \"modest.\" But with food trucks, you're often prone to paying prices not too much lower for food that's certainly inferior. Same for brick-and-mortar places, sometimes. Go for quality over quantity here and then pig out on whatever gut bombs you might find at other trucks at events.\n\nAs food trucks often do, Boqueria Street posts their menu on their various social media pages, as well as their web site (which also has a copy of the menu, sin* Iberico). That's how you'll find them, and you definitely should make the effort to try one of the best food trucks in town and one of the more interesting new food ventures, four-wheeled and four-walled alike.\n\n[*because not everyone learns at least sufficient Spanish to get by, sin = sans = without - capisce?]", "business_id": "xAhB_i6-799TakpGqVplWw", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-03-24", "useful": 8, "cool": 6}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "SWzl3C3-3R-TcOGGfV4X4g", "review_id": "_HQ1HC4ioHEttJURpdktlA", "text": "Unfortunately JC was injured on the job which forced him to close his doors.

I've never been to Italy. \n\nOn our first visit, I had to say the pizza was quite decent. Maybe I finally found some local relief from the \"New York-style\" that dominates this town. (No slam on NY-style; it just isn't my thing.) Quality ingredients, the pizza not turning to mush or congealing before the meal was over, a fair price, and a nice guy at the counter made for a tentative thumbs up. Not amazing for my tastes, but one of the better pizzas in a pizza-bereft area.\n\n(Okay, so they screwed up the second pizza entirely, which we only discovered upon getting home, but since I didn't say anything and give Bona Pizza a chance to make things right, I can't really complain here.

Same good service, same good price, same good ingredients, but not the same pizza at all.\n\nWas it a fluke the first time? Did they change their style to suit the crowds? Was I just unlucky on the second visit?\n\nThese questions in my mind, there's another problem. As noted in another review, they have started slipping into gated apartment complexes and spamming the residents with their fliers. I'm of the school that just because everyone else does it, that doesn't make littering and (essentially) trespassing acceptable.

On our trip to Pyaar the one good thing I can say about the restaurant is the owners are some of the nicest and most accommodating people you could hope to meet. Unfortunately, I really didn't like my meal here.\n\nIt should also be noted that this is a review ONLY of the dinner buffet - it's possible that ala carte menu ordering will produce a different experience.\n\nAnyway, when my wife and I discovered a new Indian restaurant was opening in town we were pleased, but the news that this one would feature an Indian DINNER buffet had us over the moon. We are night owls by nature and during vacation times or on weekends we aren't always ready to go in time for a lunch buffet - the chance of a dinner option for Indian buffet sounded perfect.\n\nTonight we went in with no expectations. $9.99 or so per person for dinner seemed like a good deal, although we were surprised that Naan had to be purchased separately (it's usually included with the buffet - this is the first time i've seen it as an extra).\n\nThe selection was small and I ran into immediate problems. I'm not sure if this is synonymous with the particular cuisine Pyaar aims at - they claim to me \"The only North-South-Mogul Indian restaurant in Vegas\" - but I was surprised at the presence of a couple of beef dishes, the lack of any real \"main\" dish for vegetarians and nothing at all with the nice sauces I've come to expect from Indian food. \n\nNo Paneer dish, no Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Makhani, no samosas, no pakora, no kofta of any sort.  What I ended up with was the only two tandoori chicken drumsticks, some of the very wet \"chilli beef\" some of the vegetable curry and a lot of rice.\n\nThe tandoori chicken was fine if unspectacular and I'd have been OK to eat that and write it off as a \"notch in the belt\" but not somewhere I wanted to visit again, but unfortunately the rest of the tandoori was thighs which I don't like. The chilli beef tasted like a generic beef stew with a bit of chilli powder added, potatoes were OK-ish but a bit hard in the vegetable curry.\n\nMy vegetarian wife fared even worse than me - ending up with some chick peas and a bit of potato on top of a bed of basmati rice.\n\nBy the time our Naan (which tasted like a flour tortilla) arrived I realised that I had nothing to mop up as there was no dish featuring any of the delicious gravies I have come to associate with Indian food.\n\nAround 3 minutes into the meal my wife pretended to receive an urgent phone call and we apologised and asked for the check. The owners felt bad for us and were extremely nice, offering to let us fill up to go boxes from the buffet and they waived the cost of the Naan. \n\nNow, perhaps it's a different type of Indian cuisine and it's just our personal taste, but we really didn't like the buffet here at all. I feel bad having to pan this place so harshly because I really liked the owners, but I hope if they read this review they consider some changes to their buffet because right now it's uninspired bordering on inedible.", "business_id": "VNOz_tOw_Hz3FAJeEHb_yg", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-06-29", "useful": 6, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g", "review_id": "cVb6ipeYcr_edXNrKOSUTg", "text": "UGH.\n\nSome of the two star reviews are being far too kind to this place.

After I checked with a friend and received confirmation that it's awesome, I beelined there for lunch, finding the place fortunately (for me) not very busy.\n\nAfter seeing the rotisserie at work right behind the counter, with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes both filling drip trays below the porchetta, I decided that I should go pick one of those as a side. Fearing a potential food coma, I kept it light by picking the Brussels sprouts ($4), which appropriately came out at the same time as the sandwich. I wouldn't outright call them mushy, but they're on the soft side and had no crunch. Also, the portion on this was a bit modest for the price. At least the Brussels sprouts are subtly tasty, likely owing to the porchetta drippings.\n\nThe owner was offering sample cups of Cilantro Chicken Soup ($5) while people waited for their orders. After tasting it, I almost had to order one to-go. It's balanced in seasoning and thickness, and the chicken was so tender that you don't even have to hear the owner say that the soup is made fresh daily. Plus, the bowl is quite generously sized.\n\nI did bury the lede a bit, and that's the brilliant Porchetta Sandwich ($12). I was worried that the \"French baguette\" bread would be tough if not outright sharp, but it was simply a delicious and chewy container for the goodness within. That treasure starts with awesome porchetta, including juicy pork loin and the crispy skin of the belly, the latter an unparalleled textural experience. The lemon sauce (with herbs) complements everything perfectly, and the fresh arugula completes the Italian-inspired experience. It doesn't get too messy compared to some sandwiches.\n\nThe porchetta alone earns Karved a top rating in my book, and the chicken soup was memorable enough for me to overlook the Brussels sprouts. Hopefully, I'll be free to come back soon to try some of their other options, including that yet-to-be-explored tri-tip.", "business_id": "cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-11-07", "useful": 13, "cool": 8}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "3H44QawcElUlPytzwtz3Bg", "review_id": "DkgVtrJF_39x8YA83uc0Lw", "text": "Just went there this weekend and no pastrami but food was still good for the family and they let me go get the pastrami at the new place and bring it back.", "business_id": "yCUM58iPU8-G6KbgmzuKjA", "stars": 4, "date": "2015-07-08", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "NAm3hV0699Z4zo3-4bSbFQ", "review_id": "yZN3jOlau0j09Syk01r1Iw", "text": "went to Vegas last weekend for training.  my cousin recommended goin to Firefly and stressed on how good it was...\n\nso we headed that way.  i was hungry.  hardly ate anything all day.  training classes from 8 to 6 with only 30 min breaks in between hour and a half  classes.  had coffee for breakfast, and a nasty spring roll from a cheap ass wanna-be asian food place at the riviera.  i was starving.\n\nwe get to firefly and the place is packed.  we were told it would be a 20 -25 minute wait.  my stomach growled at me in anger.  20 - 25 minutes????  i just might pass out during that time.  \n\nso next door was a different kind of fly.... dragonfly...an asian joint.  we proceeded to check out the menu posted on the window.  as we were doing that, one of the servers came out and assured us it was really good in there.  they enticed us with an available table right at that very moment.\n\nthe place looked pretty cool inside.  not too big.  one small bar in the corner.  cool dragonfly decor on the walls.  some kind of anime porn projecting against the wall... that was interesting.  \n\nthe service was good.  our server was actually really nice and very helpful.\n\ni had a raspberry margarita.  it wasn't too bad.  they had a pretty big selection on the drink menu.  i started with a miso soup which was actually not too bad..  i then had a volcano roll and it was... eh... ok.  portions for very small, and not very cheap.  and i was still hungry.  so my friend and i decided to split a sampler with some rice.

I ate two without the BBQ sauce and the other two without.  The meat's just good enough to eat without the sauce.  It's got good solid flavor and there can be a lot of fat on parts of the meat.  The BBQ sauce is a little disappointing.  It's sweet without a whole lot of flavor.  I prefer my BBQ sauce with a lot of herbs to bring out the taste in ribs.  I wasn't sure whether they made their own sauce or not and forgot to ask.\n\nThe greens were ok, nothing great.  The mac & cheese were absolutely spot on though.  I was amazed.

Veggie curry was pretty good.with shitake and tofu balanced with a coconut and curry sauce. It was well complimented with the Jasmine rice. Pad thai a lil saucy, strong flavor.

It's located right next to BJ's on 215 and Eastern, we went up and down the plaza expecting something small, but it's a decent size restaurant and sports bar. \n\nWe walked in and there wasn't anyone that was by the entrance so we looked pretty awkward standing around looking in to see what if there was anyone that was going to come out and greet us. Someone did maybe a minute after we walked in and we were seated nearby. \n\nThe decor was very nice and elegant, I really enjoyed the table setting and overall ambiance of the restaurant. The booth we were sitting at had direct line to the front doors, so every time someone opened the door it was pretty chilly. If you're prone to the cold like I am (at least during winter), ask to be moved!\n\nOnto the food. My friend got the Blue Water Meat Lover's platter and it looked good coming out and on the plate, but the taste was nothing notable. The meats were not marinated at all and the steak tasted over cooked. For $14, I expected more than just a few pieces of bland meat thrown on a plate. I got the crab cakes and chicken avocado cigars. The crab cakes came as a pair, there were only two for $9 and the sauce tasted like it was made from 1000 island dressing but the sauce wasn't that bad at all. The crab cake was a bit dry, they seemed to mix crab meat and a few other ingredients and then just lightly breaded before frying. I can tell you Crab Corner has much better crab cakes than these guys. The chicken avocado cigars($7), were egg rolls with some chicken, avocado,  tomato, and cheese. It also came with a sauce, the sauce was pretty good and had a nice kick to it. Trying the egg roll with and without the sauce I definitely have to say that with the sauce tastes a lot better. Out of the three dishes we ordered the egg rolls were the best seasoned. Nothing else tasted like there were any seasoning at all, if there was any. \n\nAs far as service, it took us way too long to get our food, no bread or something to munch on in the mean time, and took too long with our check. We spent most of the time waiting around. \n\nThey definitely could use a lot of improvements in service and food, I really feel bad for asking my friend to come out and try this place with me.

We could have had a more authentic meal at Del Taco. First off the food is not fresh. I ordered one chicken and one beef taco. While the white man (i guess the owner) started making mine, my Fiance peeked in the back of the kitchen and noticed bags of meat. After we were unable to hear the cleaver and the knifes cutting up the meat in the back or no meat on a skillet or BBQ , He told us there is a new batch of beef coming up . We looked at the meat and was horrified. It was all packaged pre-seasoned meat. This meat wasn't even touched by this restaurant. came right out of a bag into the tray.  Probably from Cisco or Costco. Very shameful to call them selves a Mexican restaurant! even worse the two \"chefs\" in the kitchen were Latino and serving this stuff! what would their parents or grand parents think. I think the owner needs to toss the packaged ingredients and take a trip to So cal and see how its really done. Places like this give Mexican food such a bad influence.

It was a \"rustic\" sausage with chunks of meat and such, a little sweet and a little spice. All in all a good flavor and enjoyable.\n\nThe \"Tom Kha Shrimp\" was the best soup I had had in a while. It was a little spicy from the curry, sour probably from the fish sauce and lime.

It pains me to say that since I like the Golden Gate a lot and have eaten at the Bay City Diner many times. I have been eating there almost every trip since I turned 21. We were given a breakfast menu which was very limited and only had basic, traditional items such as pancakes, waffles, bacon, and eggs. It looked nothing like the more interesting menu they have posted on their website. I should have asked if I could order off the dinner menu, but I figured I should give their breakfast a shot. I ended up ordering the biscuits and gravy. My friend both got breakfast bowls. The food was very average. It was good and hit the spot, but it was nothing special. While dinner at the Bay City Diner might not be fine dining, it is  a good meal for a great price. The breakfast was more like an average meal for an average price. Actually, with all the cheap steak and eggs specials offered at other casinos, I'm not sure how great a deal it was. All three of us cleaned our plates. One minor complaint is that I wish they would use a nice big glass for your drinks instead of the small ones they use.

Wow, what a complete fail of a business.  It's like the guys that started this food truck only did it to find a place to hang out together and play annoying gangster rap music.  While I was here, I was reminded of not only the Dad's Grilled Cheese business in town that failed, but the show \"America's Next Great Restaurant,\" where there was a contestant who also had a grilled cheese restaurant idea that was eliminated because there was nothing really original or unique about what he was doing.  Regardless, both Dad's Grilled Cheese and the contestant on TV do grilled cheese sandwiches better than the Muncheeze truck.  Hell, I do an infinitely better job at a grilled cheese than they do.  \n\nOkay On to the food.\n\nBasically, it is hard to excuse a place that supposedly specializes in grilled cheese sandwiches when they can't even melt the cheese.  Yes, both sandwiches that were ordered had no melted cheese, but were just a little warmed up.  And there was so little of it.  The quality of the bread (they only offer basic white and wheat) is also pretty flimsy.  Can I also mention that they served stale potato chips with these?\n\nThe mac and cheese bites were the neon orange mac and cheese straight out of the kraft box.  At least take the time to make your own mac and cheese from scratch.\n\nAnd the soups - they were out of lobster bisque but I question their ability to make a quality soup after tasting the tomato soup.  It was worse than a canned campbell's soup.  It was like they bought it bulk from the Cash and Carry/Smart and Final store and served it up.  And the bread bowls they served it in were cold and there was no incentive to eat the bread after attempting to finish the soup.  Anyone that yelped  liked the soup must never get to eat homemade, from scratch tomato soup and knows what it tastes like.\n\nI just can't believe how incredibly lazy the people that run this truck are and how they have the gall to call this actual food and serve it.

We told them we wanted that, and they just kind of kept staring at us while holding up a bowl.

At this place, however, you tell them what ingredients you want and they put them in the bowl for you. This is incredibly annoying when the person making your bowl is barely communicative.\n\nNot being able to put the ingredients in yourself, you end up having to tell the guy whether to put a lot or a little of something in, and even when we'd do that, he'd just put the same amount. When asked to add a SMALL amount of chili sauce, he put on a full ladle of it. When asked to put on a LOT of onions, he put on the same amount of onions as he did all the other veggies.\n\nWe were also given no direction whatsoever as to when you pay. We stood there like idiots at the cash register, as previously you would pay before you made your food or sat down. After standing there for a few seconds with no one coming over to help us, we just seated ourselves.\n\nIt was actually difficult finding a table.  Many of the tables had dishes still sitting on them from previous people who had eaten, despite the fact that we were the only ones in there currently and there were staff just standing there doing nothing. Also, even the tables that had been cleared had lots of crumbs and debris on them. We had to seriously search before finding a table that actually was clean.\n\nWe sat down at the table with our food, were asked if we wanted something to drink. We asked for Diet Cokes. Despite there being a soda machine there, it was brought to us in cans. Apparently the soda machine is not functional.\n\nThe entire time we were there, no staff member ever came over to ask how we were doing. We had to call across the restaurant to get the guy's attention when we wanted water. When we wanted to go, we called to the guy again, asking for our check. He actually just stared at us blankly. We repeated, \"Can we have the check please?\" and he looked at us uncertainly. \"The check...?\"  \"Yes, the check!\" and he finally seemed to understand and brought it over to us.\n\nThere did not seem to be a language barrier issue or anything, as on the few times the guy spoke his English was perfectly fine. He just seemed completely uninterested in serving us.\n\nWe were charged the price for the lunch special, and it was only on the way out of the restaurant that we noticed a sign saying that the lunch special came with soup and an egg roll.

Oh, if I could eat at Lulu's once a week I might die of happiness. But then I might miss out on all the future yumminess they have to offer.\n\nThe first time I tried Lulu's was at the Ellis Island Food Truck Smash-up. I had actually been stalking them for some time and really only showed up to try their food. The Italian Pork Grilled Cheese was simply to die for. Perfectly toasted bread, melty cheese, savory sliced pork, mmm. The aracini was very good, a bit on the vegetably side for me but tasty enough that I still ate them, which for me is a feat in itself (I do not like veggies.) I was amused that they called it \"Italian Fried Rice.\" Since I was on a roll with the fried things, I also had the Strawberry Shortcake Beignets. These will be yet another reason I continue to stalk Lulu's. Basically doughnuts covered in sugar and then again in macerated strawberries and whipped cream. I also bought a Nutella whoopie pie (which I had a bit later) and I have to say it was okay, I think I was not enthused by the nuts in the cake.\n\nSo for today, my boyfriend drove us all the way across town to Summerlin to grab some Lulu's in the Sugar's parking lot. Hats off to them for still working even in the rain and with their lights out in the truck. My boyfriend got the prime rib and egg sandwich, deep fried mac and cheese and I got the sourdough waffles with strawberry syrup and a red velvet whoopie pie. I have to say I like the red velvet whoopie pie loads more than the Nutella, and I am a Nutella freak. Going on, those very well might be the best waffles I have ever had. They were crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside and not sweet so as to go very well dipped into the strawberry syrup. The prime rib sandwich was good according to my bf but too many veggies for me.  However, we both had to agree that the deep fried mac and cheese was the winner for this trip. Cilantro mayo and a hint of jalapeno FTW. Crunchy, saucy and cheesy creamy goodness.

Instead, we ordered the Onion Bhajis.  What we received were the Vegetable Pakoras.  They were really good.  Crispy and light, yet still dense and fulfilling.  The cilantro sauce was awesome.  Spicy and just tart enough.  \n\nFor our entrees, my husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala ($15) as he always does.  We think this was another mix up, because quite frankly it wasn't very creamy and it had way too many peppers and onions in it, which leads me to believe it was the Chicken Jalfrazi.  That would explain the extra spiciness that one usually does not find in Tikka Masala.  \n\nThey have you order by #.  Which I think is going to be kind of challenging given the goofs we have experienced thus far.  Again, first day...\n\nI ordered the Lamb Korma ($16).  Oh my goodness, it was wonderful.  The lamb was tender and falling apart.  The sauce was very flavorful and had just the right amount of heat so I could feel a bit of sweat building up on my chin.  Yummmy!  I loved mine, a lot.\n\nWe also had some Saffron Rice ($4).  It was tasty too.  Nothing special, it's rice after all.  \n\nThere prices are a bit more expensive than our usual India Palace, but the portions are substantially larger.  Allowing more than enough for leftovers.  Except for the rice, if two want leftovers the next day, order 2 sides of rice.  \n\nFinal verdict, I will definitely go back for some more and dine in this time as I need to make an update on the floor service.\n\nThe interior is lovely, but the lighting was a bit too bright when we were there.  Also, they should have had some fabric draped from the ceilings as it would have make a marked difference to the level of coziness and warmth.  \n\nP.S.  daily lunch buffet, if you're into that kind of thing...", "business_id": "mUk-0jToBuzk4KaDXp-uew", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-06", "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "6fr-cVNPoa5lQmGvqkIhFw", "review_id": "Jz4aWm2TqFI0VqupwoJxIQ", "text": "It's closed and has been closed for awhile.

And that is coming from someone who is pregnant, craving pizza, and starving. I needed good NY style pizza. And this was so far from that. \n\nMy negative experience started off by walking into the restaurant, where no one greeted us. The place was empty, so I should have taken a cue from that, but decided to give it a chance since it's right down the street from my new house. \n\nOne of the owners was behind the counter, the other was sitting at a table with his crap all over it. Judging by the discoloration of the tablecloth,  it looked like he has been sitting there in the same spot for the past 25 years to the point where he has become a permanent fixture in the restaurant. It also looks like the decor has remained the same for the past 25 years. But I digress. \n\nWe ordered cheese pizza by the slice. $2.50. That wouldn't be bad if it were a big ol' delicious slice of NY pizza.\n\nShe takes out these slices of pizza.... that looked TINY first off.... and old and cold. I asked \"Are those slices fresh?\" And she responds. \"Yes, I make my pizza fresh everyday.\" Um, I didn't ask if you made it within the past 24 hours, I asked if it was fresh out of the oven. I clarified, and asked \"Was it made recently?\" And she said \"According to health code, I have to make them in the morning and put them in the refrigerator right away. Then I heat them up to order.\" Where I come from, that's not fresh.... but okay. \n\nI order extra garlic and ask if that's fresh. She says yes, then pulls out a huge jug of minced garlic and uses her bare hands to grab the garlic and rubs it all over my pizza. Gross!  The food comes out and as expected, it looks like greasy, re-heated day old pizza. The taste was bland and unsatisfying. Completely subpar. I would have been happier ordering from a chain.\n\nAfter completing our meal, we leave and neither owner says goodbye or thank you for coming.... and we were the ONLY people in the restaurant.

Their warm and chewy pita chips are my favorite version I've come across; the $4 portion with creamy hummus is huge enough to be a meal in itself.\n\nBoth visits have treated me to lots of staff interaction, from answering my annoying questions about the food to trying samples of other dishes and getting detailed info about their menu and concept.

All we wanted was a Cuban Sandwich ($5) and a Iced Cuban Coffee ($1).  What the Husband liked about their sandwich was that they had two variations of pork in there - slow roasted pork leg and rosemary ham.\n\nThey also gave us a complimentary order of their Dirty Chips ($4) which was so awesomely good that it had us wanting more!  There's barbecued pulled pork, Mexican cheese, jalapeno hollandaise sauce and cilantro sitting on a bed of potato chips.  \n\nOf course, we couldn't say no to an order of their Key Lime Beignets ($4).  It's dusted with coconut sugar alongside a Tres Leches Caramel sauce and it's yum yum good!  And plenty enough to share!\n\nAs a result, we're always looking for where their truck is and the Husband got another chance to savor their Dirty Chips once again.\n\nMost recently, we found them last week and although Dirty Chips wasn't on their blackboard, it's on their printed menu (so be sure to ask)!  The Husband wanted his own order, so we got two.  I also got an order of their Roasted Chicken Mac N Cheese ($6).  It's definitely more chicken and cheese than mac, that's for sure!  The chicken was so super moist and juicy and it had to be a crime to be considered chicken!  That dark meat sure taste good!  It's dripping with cheese sauce, and there's also some mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in there too.\n\nSadly, I haven't been able to order their beignets due to a restricted diet, but they had them with strawberries last week.  Also unique was their Homemade Corned Beef Hash Sandwich that I saw a few people chowing on.  \n\nOverall, the Husband won't bother with a food truck meet up if Lulu's and SnoW Ono aren't there.  Good thing I agree with him!\n\nNote: Double check the prices - they are listed differently on the blackboard menu and the printed sheet one.

Hands down. Good, GOOD stuff.\n\nIf you know good BBQ and, like us, you're stranded in a place (West Coast) where you're pretty sure most of the yanks around you have no clue what good BBQ is ... your refuge is Harry O's. \n\nLet's get down to it shall we? As a BBQ connoisseur who loves Tulsa BBQ over fake a#@ Kansas CIty bs. And who understands the Carolinan's get BBQ. And who knows that a good southern family who can cook some mean BBQ with a dry rub in their backyard beats any commercial hocus pocus out there ... As a BBQ aficionado I was so fricken shocked and happy to have found us some Harry O's. \n\nHarry O's is a needle in a haystack. A gem encrusted needle. \n\n++++ LOVE the service. They are nice and attentive people. It's a small family owned feeling kind of business which is a nice break from the vanity of Vegas.\n \n++++ LOVE their fried okra. \n++++ LOVE their collard greens.\n++++ LOVE their bacon baked beans. They really do get how to make good baked beans. Not a lot of places get that.\n++++ LOVE their dry rubbed ribs. They were just perfect. Nice and dry thin skin layer on the outside and moist, juicy, smoked flavored goodness on the inside. Anyone who knows good BBQ knows not to jack the flavor of the smoked meat up with thick overpowering sauces that give way to stomach indigestion later. Harry O's gets it.\n++++ LOVE the brisket. Like the ribs it wasn't saturated and slathered in BS sauce. It was moist and chewy and allowed to exude it's own mild flavor on it's own. \n++++ LOVE their dry rub. It's a demure and humble flavor. Nothing overpowering but most certainly complimenting to the smoked flavor. \n++++ LOVE their corn bread. It's like eating buttery clouds of magic. \n++++ LOVE the mac and cheese. It was a proper mix of fluffy cheese and pasta. The flavor was a melty / buttery / mild chedder. Hadn't had mac n' cheese in a decade and loved this stuff.\n\n+ Like their sweet tea. No complaints and they're generous with how much they serve you. \n+ Like their sauce. It's on the side so you can have as much or as little as you like. It wasn't an overpowering sauce at all. Had a nice orange flavor to it. Still though, the meat + dry rub is all you need to achieve BBQ bliss. \n\n= Neutral about that facade of the business. Actually I like it on foot and the interior because it's not pretentious and you ease into your seat and dig into your food without a care. The shopping center this Harry O's is in though looks like something you should drive right pass and not think about and that's what I am neutral too.\n\nAnd that's it. Harry O's is the first officially delicious, proper southern style BBQ place I've found living on the West Coast.

The guys working are nice and seem to genuinely care about putting out quality food that tastes great. When you place your order don't expect to get handed food right away. They make everything to order and it can take time, but it's well worth it. \n\nJamon Iberico ($13) - This is some tasty ham! The split-top rolls that they grill in butter really hold the fillings in nicely and tastes great. While I like this sandwich, I actually recommend the quesadilla which is stuffed with iberico ham, mushrooms and mozzarella. \n\nPatatas Bravas ($7) - This is a full portion, but you can add a smaller version for $3 to any meal. The menu describes this as fried potato wedges with Barcelona style spicy sauce. I like the patatas bravas a lot, but the flavor hasn't been consistent each time. Sometimes the sauce it much spicier than other times and even has a different color. \n\nVaca Saltada ($11) - Braised beef, manchego cheese, red onion, spicy yellow chili mayo on a split-top roll grilled in butter and topped with pretty edible flowers. The beef has great flavor and all the fillings compliment each other well. This sandwich was well liked by all in my group that tried it. \n\nCroquetas ($7) - There's chicken inside these fried tasty gems.

I really liked how this last Thanksgiving they had the option to add a side of gravy, score! Where has this gravy been? Please bring the gravy back as a regular menu item because it pairs so nicely with The Bobbie!

I had looked forward to Canter's coming to Summerlin. As it turned out, the place is infested with astronomical prices and infinestimal service. My brother was so disgusted by his $20 pastrami sandwich plus $3 for a side dish that he wrote his second Yelp review.\n\nI knew that Canter's was opening a second Las Vegas location on the Strip. In the front of my mind I knew that if a pastrami sandwich is close to $20 in Summerlin, it would be off the charts expensive on the Las Vegas Strip. When all is said and done, I wasn't chomping at the bit for this Canter's to open.\n\nThroughout this week we'd pass through the Linq between the Orleans shuttle stop and the Strip. Near the High Roller on an empty storefront door there was a small sign saying that Canter's is Coming Soon. I was surprised when I was walking in the Linq when my olfactory senses alerted me to Canter's. Only a few hours ago, it was an empty storefront. Canter's had just opened a couple of hours ago. Expecting price shock I asked if there was a take out menu. The friendly lady said they had been open about an hour and that I can take pictures of the menu. I did just that, then outside the Linq evaluated the choices. Astonishingly a pastrami sandwich on the Strip is a few dollars less than the exact one in Summerlin. And astonishingly, this deli does not offer the very popular deli staple: kosher. However, they do offer an egg salad sandwich, which is not too common in Las Vegas. So, I followed my olfactory senses back to the aroma of deli food. Disparite from the majority of the menu, the price for the egg salad sandwich is fair. The egg salad sandwich with the choice of bread (including a bagel) and two sides is $9.25 and a bottomless plastic cup of a Coke product is $3.\n\nThe same friendly employee that greeted me a few minutes previous nicely told me to seat myself. In this large room filled with Canter pictures and a new restaurant scent, I sat myself then waited and waited and waited. I'd even change my seat to the center of this uncrowded newly opened deli. Finally a server asked me what I wanted to drink. A Coke ($3).He'd place the drink on the table then the service disappeared. It seemed that I likewise disappeared. Servers just passed me by. Service was nonexistent. I'd see the staff standing at the entrance of the kitchen. I'd even see a manager seated at a table across from me that failed to acknowledge me. Then there was an employee sweeping that failed to acknowledge me. Nobody offered me a menu, although I assume that I was supposed to take one when I served myself. After approximately twenty minutes of being the invisible man, I preferred to be a visible man and exchange my hard earned money with a waitstaff that acknowledges me.\n\nOn its first day of opening, Canter's does not have a bug to fix. Just common sense! If somebody is seated for twenty minutes without a menu, there is a good chance that he might want somebody to acknowledge him and place a menu on the table so that he could order something. Possibly even a $17 pastrami sandwich. Canter's needs to offer more deli food that reflects on their original location. This includes Kashe. Finally Canter's needs to rethink their pricing strategy.\n\n....................\nReviewer's note: I gave 2 stars instead of 1 optimistic that the Management team will read this review and fix the issues discussed in this review. Las Vegas has a shortage of delis. If Canter's Management addresses these drawbacks it has the potential to provide a much needed good deli in the Las Vegas market.", "business_id": "VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A", "stars": 2, "date": "2017-10-20", "useful": 9, "cool": 7}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "RGLmRxE2pyAdOZ1l_DBUNw", "review_id": "HHAHfn9smWDVbiUGVVd2mg", "text": "The idea of Chicago style pizza so close to my house made me happy, especially since I am originally from the Midwest.

I was a bit skeptical coming here after the other reviews but decided to check it out anyways and I am sure glad we did!  They are really taking out Yelp reviews to heart!  So if you had a not so good experience in the past I would suggest trying them out again!  \n\nWe were greeted and seated promptly by the hostess.  I did notice that there was someone always at the hostess stand or in the area watching for people coming in.\n\nOnce seated we were greeted promptly by our server and she checked on us during our meal at the right times!  She brought us our drinks and some pretzel rolls!  We ordered the Jerk Shrimp Tacos and the 3 Meat plate.  The foods was excellent!  There were 3 smaller, 4\" tacos which hit the spot!  They had the right amount of spice with a bit of a kick and the shrimp were cooked perfectly!  They came with a Tequila Lime sauce, cabbage and a pico de gallo!  The 3 Meat plate looks much different from the photo already posted.  The plate included chicken, pork and beef for meat.  It had sweet plantains as well as rice and beans and red peppers.  This was a great dish and well worth the price!  \n\nThey have a great Happy Hour, $2 off the Tapas as well as drink specials!  \n\nEffective tomorrow they will be serving breakfast on Saturdays and Sunday's.  \n\nOn Friday, Saturday and Sunday's they have live music, which starts at 7pm.  We left before the music so I cannot say how good they were!\n\nThere is a great, nicely sized outside seating area!  I cannot wait to meet up with some people to make use of this area! Being that they are located off of Eastern, they have glass wall where you can see whats going on if you want too but helps avoid with the smell of traffic.\n\nThe bar was cool!  They had TV's so you can watch the game!  This area was somewhat separated from the dining room but you could still see the stage for the music in the dining room! Which was nice!  \n\nI hope that this restaurant will be around for some time!

A recent  Yelp event gave us a taste, which was a good thing since we found ourselves in the neighborhood earlier this week.\n\nI remember they were offering Happy Hour from 4 pm to 7 pm, so we scooted our butts in for some Monday night football.\n\nHappy Hour means half all appetizers (except the Spicy Ahi) and $2 off drinks.\n\nAfter walking in and the bartender greeting us, we took a seat in the dining room in front of the large screen.  With a pretty decent selection of apps to choose from, we decided on four:\n\n* Potato Pancakes \"Ham, potato and chive pancakes with applesauce and your choice of horseradish or sour cream.\" ($7.99)  Four pancakes that are lightly fried and tasty.  We automatically got sour cream with ours, which was no biggie since we didn't even remember horseradish was an option.\n\n* Crab Cakes \"Crab cakes drizzled with our creamy mustard sauce and pineapple relish.\" ($10.95) - You actually get crab cakes, as in the plural, when you order this.  Three to be exact.  And the creamy sauce added to this dish very nicely.  You can tell there's definitely a decent amount of crab and not just filler in these cakes.\n\n* Chicken Wings \"Ten wings served with celery, carrots and your choice of ranch or bleu cheese dressing.  Available in BBQ, Honey Mustard, Teriyaki, or Buffalo style.\" (Boneless $11.95 / Traditional $10.95)  The Husband remembers seeing other yelpers order this from before, so he was game to get his own share.  I was surprised when the order of 11 wings showed  up.  He chose boneless and buffalo style.  They were meaty pieces of poultry and what a steal at half off! \n\n* Queso Cammarones \"Shrimp, artichoke hearts and sauteed spinach, melted together in a blend of provolone, romano and parmesan cheeses.  Served with tortilla chips.\" ($8.95) - Your basic artichoke and spinach dip, but taken to a new level with shrimp hidden underneath.  It's a heavy dish and you definitely need to share this one for sure! \n\nService - what can I say?  Our waitress was friendly, the owner said hello when he passed by, and someone from the kitchen came by to chat with us not once, but twice!  And the bartender thanked us for coming in when we left!  They are a friendly bunch here!  We even got little martini shakers as gifts during out visit! \n\nOther appetizers worth checking out would be their oysters on a half shell, bleu cheese tomatoes, and red pepper hummus! Next time!\n\nOverall, I'm always pleased when I find a restaurant with great happy hour specials and Straight Up definitely offers some good ones! \n\nThey also have different events for each day...better call ahead to double check if they are still going on though!\n\nMondays: Buy One Get One Specialty Martini 1/2 off 7 pm to close; karaoke at 10 pm with Karate Karaoke\n\nTuesdays: 2 for 1 Tacos, 2 for 1 Coronas, $4 Margaritas\n\nWednesdays: Live Jazz at 9 pm\n\nThursdays: 50% Off Specialty Martinis for Ladies from 7 pm to midnight\n\nFridays: Live Hawaiian and Reggae Bands at 11 pm\n\nSaturdays: Beauty Industry receive $3 off Specialty Martinis and 50% Appetizers\n\nSundays: Sunday Brunch at 10 am to 2 pm; Hospitality Industry receive 50% food and drinks all day; Wii Games from 6 pm to closing with a winner getting a free well drink!\n\nUpdate!  We returned the following week...\n\n* Roasted Red Pepper Hummus \"Served with crispy tortilla chips.\" ($6.95) - It's served with pita chips, not tortilla chips.  But that wasn't the problem, the hummus was really dried out.  Not sure if they make their own, but it was definitely lacking in olive oil.  I thought I had tried it before at an event, but I guess not.  Nonetheless, I brought home the leftovers and added some EVOO to help bring it back to life.  It still was lacking.\n\nWe also ordered the chicken wings again and attempted to order their \"Spicy Garlic\" style, which was something off the menu.  Unfortunately, the day we went, that chef working wasn't familiar with that style.  He did offer to make it for us, but we decided to stick with what was on the menu.  They also ran out of ranch dressing.  We were told they make it fresh, and the waitress was able to scrape up a little bit of what was left.  But by the time she asked if I needed more, the wings were done.

I've been here before when the restaurant was something else and it was just okay as I recall. Tonight was just a different, better, vibe and food was marvelous. I ordered 3 tapas: Tuna Sashimi, Jerk Shrimp-anadas, and Fabulous Boneless Mango BBQ Ribs. The only reason why I didn't give this review 5 stars was because I have yet to try a full meal but will definitely be back to do that next.\n\nTuna Sashimi had a nice seared flavor and wasn't overpowered by its accompaniments. Jerk Shrimp-anadas wasn't spiced high like you'd think a jerk spice might be, but was just right for most people I'd think. I like spicy foods so it could have been turned up a notch for me. The Boneless BBQ Ribs were caramelized with slightly crispy edges as I like my ribs to have, and moist inside. Nice idea, to not have to get messy and all hands-in with bones. Hats off to the chef!\n\nI hope more patrons give this place a chance and support a newly opened business run by locals.

The lady at the counter repeatedly emphasized that they used \"fresh chickens\" (I'm hoping she meant organic, since I'd hate to be served salmonella marinated chicken).  The chicken was relatively moist with a citrusy tang, although it reminded me more of store-bought italian dressing rather than a vibrant zest of fresh lemon or orange.  The skin was lacking the crisp that makes ingesting those extra calories worthwhile and on the same subject, I'm not a huge fan of their garlicky spread.  It looks too much like sour cream or mayonnaise, and it packs an excessive punch of garlic.  So much so that it lingered in my mouth for several hours.

Yes even Hubby gets to the point  of no return on buffets, he wanted a real burger!  Hit the Groupon app on my phone just in case (if you dont groupon- you should!) and found Wildburger at the WildFire Lanes location on E Sunset.  $10 for $20 credit sounded good so off we went!\n\nOn the steps of Wildfire, I noticed the cigarette smell immediately, walking in confirmed it.  This isnt one of the mega-casinos with fancy filtration and circulation.  The Wildburger isnt too far from the doors but if smoke bothers you, be warned.  You order at the register on walking up, then seat yourself inside the restaurant space to eat.  I was concerned about how many people were in line ahead of us, but Ashley the cashier was quick, clear and cheerful to talk to.\n\nInside the tables were clean, well stocked, and the fresh brewed iced tea was great!  When it began to get low they immediately started another batch & it was out promptly.  When the server brought our food she asked if we needed anything and quickly filled the request.   The food was yummy!  Hubby's half pound Wildburger came out exactly as he likes, brioche bun, tillamook cheese & signature slaw making it tower over the plate.  At 7.99 including fries (also quite good) this is a very reasonably priced dinner.  My chicken breast was tasty & placed on a perfectly toasted sesame bun and I loved every bite!  The onion strings were good but the fries were better, just as Ashley told me when asked.\n\nSeeing deep fried twinkies on the menu ($4.99) I asked & was told yes, they still have REAL twinkies, and she described it as being between a Krispy creme donut and a funnel cake - SOLD!   It was delicious - dusted with powdered sugar, though I would have liked a drizzle of raspberry sauce or something to take it to the next level.\n\nOverall, not too smoky in the dining area, great burgers & sandwiches cooked to order, reasonable prices, good iced tea & a great dessert, and courteous & cheerful service = return visits!  After our groupon savings ($10) our dinner cost was $11 plus tip!

I can say they need to take the Texas paraphernalia because this place is NOT TX BBQ. It's decent BBQ mind you, but it doesn't compare to anything I've eaten back home. Beef brisket was OK, creamed corn was gross. It was like corn sitting in corn water with tons of pepper. Nothing like creamed corn is in TX! Also the serving size is the saddest \"small\" for $1.99 I've ever seen in my life. My fiance (a creamed corn fan) declared it the worst cream corn ever made. I'd have to agree!\n\nThe issue with the meat is that instead of big slices of meat falling of the sandwich you get *diced* meat. You don't DICE meat at a BBQ restaurant as it's just a ploy to hide fatty gross pieces in your sandwich. A place with quality brisket actually wants you to see pretty slices and doesn't have anything to hide. The serving size on the sandwich was also very small - no wonder their prices are a litte lower. \n\nI was also disappointed to find out there were no combos with a sandwich and a potato. I asked if I could pay more to get a potato with my sandwich combo. \"SURE\", \"ok great\". \"So did you want me to ring it up as a sandwich combo + a potato or as a sandwich + a potato + a drink?\" . HUH, how is that paying extra to upgrade a combo? I'm just paying full price for everything? \n\nOverall I was pretty disappointed. The state of TX wants it's name back!

We get seated and order some chaat - which was OK but not as good as I remember it.   Fine.  We tried to order the Samosas too (like the first review) but they were still out... after 3 days?  Indian restaurant with no samosas?  Its like peanut butter and no jelly!   Turner and no Hooch! \n\nAhh... let's move on.  We also ordered a full dish of Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala curry.   The food comes out relatively fast - but we had the same problem as the first reviewer - the curry had no curry!  Normally the complaint is too much sauce, no meat.  This was all meat, onions and peppers, and a tiny bit of curry.  That would have been OK, but the meat was... tough?  \n\nTough, over cooked meat?  I can't even remember the last time I ever had overcooked chicken in a restaurant.  Maybe at some backyard BBQ when they forgot to check on it after 30 minutes, but not in a restaurant!  Not for a $15 dish!!  Dry, tough chicken, yuck.\n\nThe full dish of Tandoori Chicken for $15 is big.  SO BIG, it barely fits on the serving plate.  That's cool and all, but I'm making a mess just trying to get food off the plate.  Plus, the Tandoori is DRY TOO!  WTF!!  It's supposed to be succulent and appetizing and yummy.  Instead we're both depressed and barely touch either dish.  We get it to go for lunch tomorrow.  \n\nI wake up the next day and what do I find my SO doing?  Cooking lunch.

It's a beautiful restaurant, clean and inviting.  It would do well in the evening as a romantic spot.\n\nAs we waited at the hostess stand, we heard a large party in the dining room laughing and having a good time.  That was a good sign.  Other than that large party, we saw no one.  So we waited, and waited.  And waited.  No one should have to wait at the hostess stand for more than 45 seconds, so that was a negative start.\n\nWe decided to take matters into our own hands and head to the 'sports bar' part of the restaurant.  A friendly face greeted us and told us to sit anywhere we liked.  This was fine, since we both wanted to watch a bit of the NFL Combine anyway.\n\nWe both ordered drinks - he a Jack and Coke, me a house Pinot Grigio.  Both were acceptable.\n\nWe decided on some tapas.  We ordered the Coco Shrimp (coconut crusted fried butterflied shrimp).  It came with a wonderful sauce that resembled an ambrosia. Good stuff.\n\nWe also ordered the crab stuffed poquillo peppers.  Adequate.  Not very complex as far as flavor goes.\n\nI ordered the mango boneless ribs - they were pretty tasty - and well-presented.\n\nLastly we ordered the pork sliders.  Use caution, they're a bit spicy!\n\nFor a dessert, we decided to try Chef Manny's Grandma's rice pudding.  It comes hot in a martini glass.  It was amazing, not too creamy, with just the right amount of cinnamon.  Good stuff.\n\nOverall, I can see why the main complaint is the lack of service.

A grill cheese food truck is brilliant and much more feasible.

The graphics were cute and so was the truck name...Muncheeze (genius)!\n\nTo be a fair judge as always we ordered quite a few sandwiches (Sassperilla, Chi-chi and Piggy Mac) to judge the quality of the sandwiches. I must say that I was impressed and thought that the Chi-Chi and Piggy Mac were pretty dang good. I prefer the Piggy Mac more over Chi-Chi. The bbq pulled pork was just right because it wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce and did not hide the taste of the other ingredients. The Sassperilla was drenched in A1 sauce and by the time I ate it, the sandwich was soggy. The Chi-chi was my second choice, great concept but it was a little dry. \n\nWe also had a side of Mac bites and well I wasn't a big fan of the holla-peno ketchup. I think they should have a spicy ranch dipping instead or maybe just serve with a ketchup/marinara & ranch. \n\nMy co-worker was a little disappointed that they didn't have the tomato soup on that day so another day that I went again they were out of soup...do they ever have the soup? \n\nFor $10, you can get a sandwich, bites and a drink, this saves you a couple bucks, which isn't bad considering the prices of the food truck combos. \n\nOverall the experience is worth it. Some people get annoyed with the guys blasting the music with your favorite song or whatever they are in the mood to listen to and still they're still getting a hang of the biz but this shouldn't distract you from attempting it just once.

The place looks and feels like \"Cuban food for the working class\", but it beats the other places hands down!  For one, all of the dishes we had (including our kids) were extremely hearty, rich, and flavorful.  None of this \"health-conscious\", lightened down for today's slim American type food here.\n\nEven the black beans were thick and pasty (but smooth).  The Papas Rellenas appetizer filled up my 9 year old happily, though we also ordered her a full platter as well.  We also got a rich, full-bodied chicken soup, a little like the tortilla soups you sometimes find at Mexican restaurants, but definitely unique in flavor.  My 6-year old decided to help me finish it before I had a choice.  Ropa Vieja and the Masas de Puerco were fabulous and filling, with the meats perfectly marinated and tender.  \n\nFor me, the only disappointment was the Tres Leches cake we had for dessert.  They don't make it onsite, and it had a little too 'mainstream' texture - a bit too blantantly moist, a bit too much icing, and not enough of that hidden 'cream' that surprises you with the real deal.  It just wasn't right (go to the Cuba Cafe for the perfect Tres Leches!).\n\nBut...other than the cake...this is my favorite of the 3 Cuban restaurants in town that I've tried.  If you want beautifully presented Cuban food, go to the Havana Grill.  If you want a quaint, but up-to-date chic atmosphere (and the best Tres leches cake), go to the Cuba Cafe.  But for the best overall Cuban home cooking, Varadero is the place...and make sure you come hungry and be careful NOT to over-order (not that leftovers won't taste great the next day!).", "business_id": "r7UZDbth0NtbZDJKq1-JyQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-24", "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag", "review_id": "gBme0Ic8A1QE7c5hBIoziQ", "text": "I'm convinced I'm not using the search function correctly because I'm shocked this place isn't on Yelp yet!!!\n\nI love Town Square..

When I go out I'm usually not looking for a \"scene\". I'm looking for more of a place to relax.. have a drink.. and enjoy the company of the people I'm with. If you're looking for something similar Bar Louie might be your spot!\n\nWe escaped the insane mobs at Blue Martini and stopped by Bar Louie to check out their free \"luigi\" (roast beef sandwich) promo. We barely made the 5-7 PM happy hour and were able to try some half price martinis and appetizers. \n\nThe downside of the happy hour is (and why I'm taking away a star!) that it doesn't include their awesome sounding \"specialty cocktails\". The promo was something like 1/2 off all wine, beer, appetizers, and \"martinis\". I wanted a mojito.. damnit.. Anyways, the martinis were good, but honestly the selection of 8 martinis here doesn't compare to Blue Martini. \n\nFood was good, but not amazing. We had the pretzels (YUM!

Proteins, very well chosen and blend well with everything.  The Jamon Serrano, sweet porky goodness and cured funk that pairs well with the mushrooms.  The Botifarra; naturally cased, coarse ground seasoned pork; delicious and fatty, intensified by a great chimichurri mojo verde.  Finally the vaca saltada; braised beef with manchego cheese and an earthy chili mayo, just plain good eats.\n\nDo try an order of patas bravas (deep fried thick potato wedges with a spicy aioli).  Fluffy on the inside, gently crisp on the outside, it makes a perfect, rich side to any sandwich.\n\nNote: If you have not tried Iberico ham from black footed, acorn fed pigs, AND it's on offer here, go for it.  It might not be as good as that sold by places on the Strip but at 1/3 the price, unless you're a true gourmand, your tongue won't know the difference.\n\nPrices are in line with the quality.  No foot long subs for $5 here.\n\nIf they only sold wine by the glass and that other famous Barcelona street food, churros.

Let's start with the sides first: The greens - still delicious, with a hint of bacon in them, the M &C - not bad, pretty good no real complaints, the beef brisket - tender, but wayyyy more fatty than I last remember and a little saltier too but still not bad. \n\nHowever, the ribs I'm sorry but I have to give them a solid D-. They were rubbery, barely seasoned, chewy and gristly, and no amount of their delicious barbecue sauce could compensate for their overall lack of quality. I couldn't even get the dog to eat the leftover ribs, and that's saying something since he would probably eat a rock covered with barbecue sauce if his teeth were strong enough.

The cost, however, for many of the dishes is half of what you might pay at a similar restaurant on the strip.  All-you-can-eat pasta in many different styles is $7.99.  While it doesn't show this on the menu, it is advertised throughout the casino.  Add to this the dark, romantic atmosphere and the appropriate music and you may have a nice date here (except for when someone like me brings his little kid who makes a lot of noise).\n\nThe quality of the food is quite good though it is just common Italian restaurant faire.  I always enjoy my meal and it's accessories (soup, salad, bread).  Do not fill up on the bread, of course, as all-you-can-eat ends up being one plate (the portions are quite large for one plate).\n\nLastly, the dessert was a surprise (though again, for an Italian restaurant, not so surprising).  Usually I will take my son to the bakery in Palace Station and let him pick something out.  However this time the waitress asked if we would like dessert and I asked what they had.  She mentioned Gelato (an Italian ice-cream type dessert).  When I asked her how much, she stated it was $1.99 for each (flavors like Cappucino, Pistachio and Vanilla Bean to name a few).  I expected a small, small portion but again the portion was large and we were thoroughly satisified with what we had ordered.\n\nIn summary, Pasta Palace at Palace Station is an excellent choice for an Italian dinner (hours are from 5pm to around Midnight).  On Mondays the dinner is $19.99 per person as local crooner Wes Winters performs a classic Vegas-style dinner and a show (I have not been to this but it sounds like a nice time).\n\nSince I am the first to review this, I hope others check it out and add their input.", "business_id": "QfD_KzfBGRZ1OLu1Vs1rrA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-25", "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "BRgdkgZoq5ePvGa9X6n7Ag", "review_id": "_J--KzdPWbBNfUu0QkVspQ", "text": "Cuban food is my favorite food and the best I've ever had is El Siboney's in Key West.

The chips were thin and crispy, just like I like them and the salsa had an excellent bite to it. Overall, the best Mexican food I've had since coming back from Baja last October. If you like good, real Mexican, you won't be disappointed. Don't let the \"dive-y\" look deter you from pushing the door open and going in. You won't be disappointed either! \n\nOh yeah, they have real Mexican Coca-Cola in a bottle, too.

Something happened to the heated water under the steamers, and some of the food had cooled somewhat before they got it back up to piping hot.  I won't remember all the dishes but they had vegetable samosa, a spicy lentil dish, chana masala, aloo palak, jeera rice, chicken korma, tandoori chicken, chili beef, and gulab jamon.  Except for the temperature issue, the buffet food was quite good.  I tried some dishes I have never had and it was all good.  The gulab jamon was outstanding - the first time I've had this dessert.\n\nOne issue we had was with an order of garlic nan.  There was no garlic.  There was a mixup in orders.

One of the staff (possibly the owner?) walked me through the steps it took to create this flavorful masterpiece.  Totaling a three to four hour process, pork tenderloin is first rolled inside pork belly, then cooked rotisserie-style, and sliced up into juicy, tender pieces.

I had a Chicken Caesar, I could only eat about 1/2, it's pretty big and the chkn was very good, I usually don't like white meat chicken because it can be dry but this was perfect.

Some deliver the real deal and others are poor excuses served up by people that have never even stepped foot in Chi-town. \n\nThe Taste of Chicago is located inside Lucky's. If you didn't know the kitchen was serving up Chicago style eats you'd expect this to be just another neighborhood video poker bar.\n\nFriends, also from Chicago, joined us for dinner. We were seated in the main dining floor, booths line the walls above those is old photos of the rat pack and such. Next to the main dining area there was a crooner singing old Sinatra tunes. A bit too loud, in our opinion. It was hard to carry on a conversation.\n\nWe looked over the menu and decided to try a bit of all the flavors we miss from our old home. We started with sagnaki and mozzarella sticks. The sagnaki was lit tableside, our waiter fumbled a bit to put out the flames. The cheese was floating in liquid so I was expecting it to taste like pure alcohol, but it did not. The sagnaki was good, but the pita bread was a bit stale. I didn't try the mozzarella sticks, but I didn't hear any complaints. Next, our friends had minestrone which was a decent version but served too cold.\n\nThe was a lull between our starters and main course. The staff was very apologetic. The owner came by a couple times. We were content and understanding. \n\nMeanwhile, the crooner came by and attempted to hustle for tips. He walked up and made some comment about how his jar was clean and eager awaited a tip. When we declined, he walked off in a huff and said  \"I'm a cub fan anyway.\" Okay, buddy, good for you. We would've happily dropped a few bucks in his jar when we finished our meal, but to interrupt us and solicit so rudely, it was unreal. We sat in awe. Did that really just happen?\n\nThen, everything began to unravel. The staff seemed more and more overwhelmed as more diners filled the restaurant. You could hear shouting coming from the kitchen over the tunes playing in the room next to us.\n\nOur gyro, hot dog and fries were brought out, but again we received apologies for the delay on the pizza. It would be up in a few. \n\nIt had all the makings of a chicago dog so it had promise, but the hot dog was so shriveled and dry it was not enticing, the bun was stale. Sad to say, but  the pickle & sport peppers were the highlight. I love athenian fries, their version called Zante  fries were ok. I prefer the feta evenly distributed and heated until melty and bubbly.      \n\nI didn't sample the gyro but my husband wasn't a fan. At first, he wondered if tzatziki had been left off because it was just a small dollop underneath the meat, but then he was left wishing it was forgotten, He said the taste was not good at all. \n\nOur friends pizza had mushrooms, onions, and half sausage and pepperoni. The crust was uber thin, similar to some styles in Chicago. The slice I tried lacked any pepperoni or sausage, yet it was very greasy. Mushrooms and onions shouldn't be greasy. The sauce was too sweet and acidic for my liking.\n\nThe service was attentive and they tried with the food, but execution was flawed and getting hustled for tips just killed the experience. It was so off-putting. Over the years, Vegas has collected a good number of Chicago style joints, the competition is pretty stiff.

I was then told that they don't have hot dogs. Confused, I reiterated what I was told earlier about waiting for the buns but was ignored & told that they don't have either. Another worker had showed up & entered our conversation asking, \"do you REALLY want a hot dog?\", which to me says, \"we're closing soon & we don't really want to correct what we did wrong, but I'll offer it up with a bit of sarcasm anyway\".

When we arrived and informed the hostess we were there for a birthday party, her response was \"Oh I think they're on the patio\". Oh excellent, since I know the layout of your dying restaurants SO well. She was not busy by any means. In fact, there was only one other group in the entire restaurant. We found our way to the patio and saw my friends there. The party was suppose to start at 8pm. The birthday girl informed me they had arrived there at 7:30 and were still waiting for their two drinks (it's was 7:55pm by this point). The same hostess popped in and even she looked bewildered that they had not received their drinks yet. She went out and brought it herself (slightly redeeming herself). Shortly after, our server stumbles out and informs us that it's ~*~crazy~*~ in there and says \"so i guess I'll be your server\". It is 8:30pm now and no one has even received water yet, forget about the drinks. Approximately 40 minutes later we get our drinks. This is also when they started bringing out the tapas platters that the birthday girl has pre ordered for everyone. They were beef taquitos with avocado, stuffed mushrooms, and pulled pork sliders. If I could sum up the food and be extremely nice about it, I would say it was forgettable. I tried one of the taquitos (I have had better from the frozen section of Costco), stuffed mushrooms were ok but the flavor just wasn't there, and the sliders were completely overpowered by the sauce. Drinks took on average 20 minutes to come out. Our party had ~12 people and the event was planned well in advance.

How long does it take to cook 3 meals when the place is dead?! They finally bring out out and guess what, there's seasoning on it. Due to having a sensitive stomach seasoning is out of the question. Sent it back are the rest of the meal and another 20 minutes go by and they finally being another steak. Guess what they did, rinsed it off and threw it back on the grill. It was obvious as underneath there was still some seasoning underneath. The steak was now burned not the medium well that was ordered it was well done and burned. When the manager was questioned why there was still seasoning he lied and said there wasn't even thought it was in the juice on the plate and in the napkin that I dabbed it with. \n\nAlso another order was the jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. On the menu it said a full rack of ribs. They brought out a 1/2 rack. I questioned the server and he said they only do 1/2.

Unfortunately, I only have that one experience upon which to base my assessment of Pyarr. \n\nLocated in Village Square, just a few doors down from the Regal Cinemas, Pyarr is relatively new, and its obvious it hasn't built up its clientele yet. I visited during the lunch buffet with a friend one weekday, and we were the only other people dining in there aside from one guy at his lonely table. Seating was open, but we were promptly greeted and quickly brought water as our drink orders were being taken, which left us to hit up the buffet.\n\nOf course, this is where my review gets highly subjective. The buffet selection was, let's say, not impressive. Especially not if you're a vegetarian (hello!). There were only eight-to-10 hot plates from which to choose, and none of these were fried goodies such as samosa, pakora or papadum. The selection does change daily, but I'd rather see Pyarr ixnay the bulk of its mostly ignored cold condiment selections to make room for more hot stuff. And maybe they will when business picks up.\n\nThe buffet does include a serving of their fresh naan, however, and I will say this: I think this is the best naan I've had in Vegas, even counting my beloved India Palace. And even though the selection was weak, the food I did have (jeera rice, aloo palak, yellow daal) was tasty and just spicy enough.\n\nThe service was excellent. We were being checked up on regularly, asked for feedback on specific dishes, re-filled with beverages (maybe not accurately, but ...), etc. Again, this might have been because we were the only people in the joint, but hey, it's something.\n\nEither way, I plan to come back to explore the menu further during dinner hours, so I can maybe give a more well-rounded review.", "business_id": "VNOz_tOw_Hz3FAJeEHb_yg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-15", "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w", "review_id": "ok8zu6GvJBsz3K4n6mBGDg", "text": "Was meeting with a friend who lives nearby and decided to stop by here for a quick lunch before the meeting.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean and it looks like it recently opened.

I hate heavy, chunky sauces and this was light and so flavorful. The crust was thin but had it had a bit of chewiness to it---definetley not paper thin. I had no complaints on this pizza. It was just perfect. \n\nThe bread was also a bit charred in the ends and the proportion was generous. No complaints. \n\nMy husband begged me to pick this up for Monday night football in a couple days and I agreed. In this area, our pizza choices are very limited; we are so happy to have found this place. \n\nAnd the best part was the bill: $15 bucks including tip!! Holly mozzarella! I love this place.\nI just hope they're consistent.\n\nSince my first review, we have eaten here 3 more times and the pizza is generally consistent. The first pizza we ordered was the best...the crust was crunchy and had those delish charred bubbles. The other pizzas we ordered since were a little flimsy and the crust a bit soggy but still very good. \nI also ordered an antipasta salad and I'm guessing the dressing had anchovies in it cuz it tasted and smelled fishy---at least I'm hoping anchovies in the dressing was the cause for that! We didn't like it--It was ok for me but my husband was like NO! Get it outta here! The salad itself was soggy. Also ordered the chicken fingers--yum. Very good...although a little on the greasy side but I love this style of chicken fingers. Breaded style with your choice of mild, medium or hot sauce. And the ranch dipping sauce was bomb. Best ranch I've ever had. If you like the chicken fingers from Villa, you'll love these. \nSo, we still love this place and it has quickly become one of our favorites!", "business_id": "P69Y9eN-tjTU425-1k1smw", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-11-20", "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w", "review_id": "Spso-EYFk6WRMbys9WtqIA", "text": "We went to Bar Louie for happy hour and had a great experience. The food is good but the service was even better. Our waitress Nicolle provided some of the best service we've had at any restaurant in quite some time. She was totally on top of her game -- greeting us as soon as we sat down, explaining the specials, taking our drink and food orders, bringing everything out quickly, checking back to see if we needed anything, stopping by and chatting for a bit. For happy hour beers on tap are $3, wine is $4, and appetizers are half off.\n\nHere's what we got (all appetizers):\n- Potstickers: pork dumplings w/ szechwan sauce. Cooked perfectly and tasted great.\n\n- Baked Goat Cheese: goat cheese surrounded with marinara. Comes with garlic toast. Nicolle brought out more bread when she saw we were out. It was a good dish but nothing spectacular.\n\n- Cheese Quesadilla: large enough for sharing with a few people. Tasted good.\n\n- Crab cake sliders: decent bits of crab, with lemon aioli, not too much filler. They were a little dry but tasty. I still haven't had great crab cakes in this city. The fried onions were pretty sad -- tiny stringy pieces of onions that were over fried.\n\nSome of the wines were decent. Beer was good. Food is about 3 stars, service was 5 stars.

I didn't know what to expect when I parked my bike up to the entrance but as soon as I got in there I knew it was the place to be. It's buffet meets fast food meets restaurant service, and that combination with the customer service is terrific. Totally affordable, quick, and easy.\n\nWent inside and it has really good use of space, and has a modern feel to it and plenty of areas to sit. I obviously looked slightly lost as I went up to the counter area, but the cook greeted me and asked me if it was my first time there, which it was. He showed me around and told me I could make pretty much anything I wanted. I paid first ($6.99 for a vegetarian bowl), got handed a bowl, and went to town. You go down the buffet and you have a ton of veggies and toppings to choose from. From what I could tell, my meal was completely vegan (until I put honey on the AMAZING sesame flatbread, YUM!) and all the ingredients were super fresh. I picked out some tofu, bean sprouts, zucchini, onion, snow peas, green pepper, and mushrooms. I added some garlic sauce on top, and handed it off to the cook who added some noodles and other sauces (he asked me first if I wanted it spicy, and I declined) and then added it to the big wok behind the counter. Eventually this small bowl I was handed turned into this giant plate that was also served with a side of white rice. He handed the plate to me, and told me to sit anywhere I like. \n\nAfter grabbing some chopsticks (don't do it, just eat with a fork - trust me) and some napkins, almost immediately after sitting down I was served the aforementioned sesame flatbread with honey, and a glass of ice water. Freakin' nice. And the food? DELICIOUS. The past few weeks I haven't had much of an appetite, but I ate the whole damn plate. And the bread. And downed the water. It was very tasty and left me really satisfied with the different flavorings of everything. \n\nThis place gets 5 stars for service, convenience, price, cleanliness, and it's only a 5 minute bike ride from my apartment. Epic win! I will definitely be coming back with some friends and some cash to tip the next time because the service really is excellent. Just be really careful, you may be so full that you can't Wok-On-Out!\n\nP.S. As I sat down they played Lady Gaga. As I left they played Katy Perry.

Very much worth the wait. \n\nI was there with 5 of my friends and we wanted a taste of everything. Knowing we couldn't possibly eat everything, we opted for 2 or three things and passed them around.\n\nFor the throwdown, Lulu's offered a veal bratwurst, oscar style. The brat was perfectly cooked and the oscar was fairly well executed. My friends loved the roll it was dressed in. It was a good dish, but I would have preferred a little less on the chopped peppers and a little more salt for pop (a few bites seemed a tad bland). The sauce was a little thin for me (texture) but for what they were trying to do it was a really good dish overall. \n\nLet's face it, aside from my personal preferences, they were obviously doing something right because this dish was the winner! Add to that the amount of food was quite a lot (translation: great value for the money) and perfect for us to share!\n\nWe also tried the dirty chips (OK, we devoured them with abandon and debated on getting more). Salty goodness with layers of amazing flavors and a few different textures, these fresh and handmade chips are dressed and presented to be a great dish on their own or as a complement to the rest of your Lulu's meal.\n\nThe sweets were all cake/cookie types so I only tasted a tiny bite here and there, but everyone went nuts for the black cherry biegnets - perfectly fried, amazing fruit - and the whoopie pies. The cookies were good but, in my opinion, just cookies. Nothing spectacular. I thought it was a great way to make the crowd happy when the girls walked through passing them out as treats while you waited.\n\nThe service was stellar. Imagine thousands of people milling about in the rainy Vegas heat (hot, humid, hungry folks in a crowd environment? Yikes!). It felt that half the festival was at Lulu's while we were there, and yet they powered through the orders with smiles and fast service. When there was a slight delay in our order, they communicated it and gave us whoopie pies to go with our order.

Upon arrival, he decided that one was simply not going to enough to share and ended up eating his to go piece right then. Even though I had originally said no dessert, I once again had no issue with scraping up that last little morsel of this light and lucious cake.  I also decided a coffee sounded like the perfect compliment, and the lovely waitress recommended the Cuban espresso.

It wasn't bad, but not fantastic either. Nothing I would return for. \n\nThe dining area was average. I liked The vineyard look to it.

The execution still needs a little work though.\n\nI appreciate the trendy food truck craze that is currently overtaking every major city. I think it's awesome. Muncheeze menu is outstanding. There's a little something for everyone. You have the grilled cheese that includes pulled pork and mac n' cheese, or the one that has steak, or the classic ham & cheese, or a combination of cheeses and bacon. Everything in that last sentence flows so beautifully. I'm a cheese enthusiast, so if there is cheese on something I'm usually gettin down with the get down.\n\nUnfortunately where Muncheeze falls short is the quality of the food. Unlike their sister truck Slidin Thru, they miss on a few key points. If I order a grilled cheese, there better be a lot of cheese on there. If I order your grilled cheese that includes 3 different types of cheese, THERE BETTER BE A LOT OF CHEESE. That was not the case when I ordered the Cheesy Lovers Delight (I selected American, Cheddar, and Mozerella). The cheese was barely noticeable, that was disappointing. If it had more cheese it would have changed my whole experience. I decided to get the combo meal, appropriately named the Munchbox Combo which included a tasty glass Coca-Cola and Mac-Bites featuring Holla-peno ketchup. The Mac Bites were a bit greasy and lacked a real cheesy flavor, so those fell short as well.\n\nAnother disappointment was that they were out of Lobster Bisque, or, they never really had any since we got to the truck 20 minutes after the windows opened. At first they weren't sure if they had Mac Bites as well. I thought the organization was a little all over the place this time around.\n\nWith the awesomeness of Slidin Thru I definitely had high expectations for Muncheeze. Unfortunately they fell short.

We were staying at the Bluegreen resort for the first time and saw their flyer in our room. After missing lunch with our friends, we were starving and called down to order. We did walk past the door twice, but then darted in and watched the owner bake our pizzas. He was really nice and chit-chatted with us while we were standing there. I loved the layout of the place. There is nowhere to sit, but he has glass up almost like a sub sandwich place for protection of the food, and so you can see the whole place. It was really neat standing there and watching our pizza cook and brown and watch the owner work the oven. You could tell this is what he does and has a passion for. Here's what we ordered and what we thought:\n\nCheese Pizza: Simple cheese pizza, done amazingly right. The owner pulled it out of the wood fire oven and it already looked amazing, but then he did a spiral of some kind of sauce. We brought it up to our room and started to devour it. My word, I have never had such a tasteful pizza. It was thin, which I normally don't like, but I loved this one! The flavor of the dough was great, and the wood fire taste imbedded in it was perfect. The cheese, the sauce, I didn't NOT like anything about this pizza.\n\nPepperoni Pizza: Basically everything I said about the cheese, transfers to the Pepperoni as well. The flavors were amazing and the owner uses little pepperoni's instead of the large ones. I loved them so much! The meat had such great flavor and wasn't spicy like some can be either. I couldn't make up my mind if I wanted the cheese or the pep more. YUM!\n\nWhile talking with the owner waiting for our pizzas he told us that he special orders his dough from New Jersey because the water here is too hard and doesn't make the dough the same. That information itself shows how much he cares about his product and that he knows his stuff. Every time we go to Vegas we will be stopping by here again.

The menu consisted of half \"Chicago\" style food and half Greek food, a weird combo but it sounded promising.\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to go for the Greek food instead of the pizza. He ordered some gyro plate and I ordered the vegetarian plate plus an order of hummus. \n\nHummus - served cold - was obviously from a jar or bag. Terrible. The pita that accompanied it was cold as well but just OK.\n\nThe server was super polite and tried to be efficient. He always asked when we were ready for the next course, he preferred to bring food out when we were ready instead of all at once. \n\nHe brought out our Greek salads next. It was the most pathetic Greek salad I've ever eaten. While the greens were fresh and crisp, it lacked in flavor. Something was just missing, the dressing seemed like it was just tasteless vinegar, and there was no seasoning at all. Just a little sprinkling of feta which also didn't have much taste. \n\nMy boyfriend didn't like his entree - said it had no flavor. It was served on a bed of yellow rice and had a side of tzsiki. My vegetarian plate consisted of cold grape leaves, spanakopita (the only good item on the plate), another side of the tasteless hummus, and a side of tzsiki.

This is a small, family-owned pizzeria. It's got an average sized menu of all of the normal pizzeria fare, plus some greek options like gyros. They seem to have lots of options for cutting your bill down like daily specials, coupons, and Groupon-Now. They've got a TV on in the dining area, it's clean. Not a whole lot really stands this place out from the rest when you look at the basic facts, but one thing will bring me back in the future: their service. \n\nI purchased a Groupon-Now deal on my smart phone and drove to the location specified. I nearly passed it because it's tucked away behind a gas station. I walked in and was instantly greeted. I like that, by the way. There was a young gentleman and an older one behind the counter and both were extremely polite. I settled on a gyro and a vegetarian pizza. Prices were really reasonable, I'd be back for daily specials etc. in the future. \n\nAfter ordering I was asked if I wanted the gyro to come out at the same time as the pizza, or if I wanted to eat while the pizza was being cooked (they knew the pizza was mainly for my coworkers and the gyro was for me). How curteous! I agreed on eating the gyro while waiting for the pizza. It was brought out to me in a basket, a filling portion with yummy seasoned fries. The dressing for the gyro came on the side, which I thought was nice, and it was one of the better gyros I've had. He cautioned that everything was hot and asked if he could get me a water to go with my meal (I didn't order a drink). Again, how nice!\n\nIt was a quiet atmosphere when I was eating - they were slow for a Sunday night so I didn't get to see them interact with anyone else. I watched TV and just as soon as I was finished I saw the younger gentleman box up my pizza. He was going to bring this out to me too, but I beat him too the punch. He smiled warmly and thanked me again for my business. You could really sense their eagerness to do anything to make me happy. How refreshing.\n\nI had such a pleasant dinner here between working, it made the rest of my night go smoother. The gyro was really good, and my coworkers all were enthusiastic about the taste of the pizza (I tried it later - after it'd cooled and it still had good flavor - much better crust than I'd thought possible!). All said and done I think I'll be coming back here - if only to have the same quality service.", "business_id": "rcn2JoLFQhMZeDHfOZiw2w", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-05", "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "-K3I3SCFvPS_Aw8B4gBtVQ", "review_id": "rMuzTWS8ORo4SLCjmiZ5fQ", "text": "I have eaten at this restaurant several times.

Finally tried it out. & we will now be regulars for brunch on the weekend. First of all, we like any place that our dog is welcome. Second of all, they had it all going on for the dogs.The cool thing is the dog's meals are free and the people breakfast prices are very reasonable. $12.95 for the lobster eggs bene and $8.00?? for the steak and eggs. They bring out a small appetizer for the pooch when you arrive and a fresh bowl of water for them too. Then they get to order either chicken or filet mignon and they are served their brunch along with you. Our ten pound Miss Lily loved the apps and the \"filet\"....though it was such a generous serving, she needed a \"people\" bag to go. They do charge $2.00 for frosty paws dessert . Lily was stuffed and generously shared her dessert with a very willing english bulldog. Didn't we teach her great manners? :) It really is all about he dogs and the staff makes sure every critter is greeted and checked on. Fun, fun, fun.\nAs for us, Two of us had lobster eggs benedict YUM! and the other two two legged friends had steak and eggs. The benedict had a nice sized piece of lobster on each half along with the obligatory can. bacon, poached egg and hollandaise. Steak and eggs were very good too. \nBTW This looks a little suspect when you drive up, and it is in a NON trendy neighborhood. I was a little hesitant, but I decided to try it and abandon all snobbery and have a good time. I am so happy that I did and I am sure Lily is too. The owner and the chef made the rounds and made us all feel very welcome. They are going to start a wine tasting soon. Sign me up. BTW make reservations cuz the patio is small.

Years later,  it was sold and renamed Amalfi Pizza, claiming the same ownership, which wasn't true. The pizza recipe had changed- too much of a spice in the pizza sauce.

The cheese pizza was just as how Villa Pizza made it (the original new york style cheese pizza). Carmine and his son (who also manages the other restaurant locations as well) said Hello, which was nice.

One of the girls even took our plates for us. \n\n  My friend and I ordered the same thing, a chicken bowl with added steak and a drink. The price was roughly $35. I really enjoyed their salsa bar. Though I enjoyed all of the sauces, the Pico was my favorite.  The rice we got in our bowl was soggy and not very appetizing, the beans were okay, the steak tasted like boiled beef stew, and the chicken was amazing! That chicken, I will definitely order that again! \n\n  I will be coming back because of the friendly people, the delicious chicken, and the generous salsa bar.

Their prices are great and their food has that home made taste that many places struggle to capture, but El Cordobes does it with ease.\n\nIf I had to describe this place in one word it would be \"authentic\". Their menu isn't tailored towards Americanized Mexican food like so many other places do. You won't find a salsa bar or queso dip, but you will find tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and things like goat soup.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you'll notice the dining area is very small, just a few booths and some tables in the middle. I wouldn't come here as a large group, as I don't think they would have the staff to handle it even if they had the room. This seems like a place that always has just one cook and one server.\n\nI love the salsa here, though be warned it is a little spicy and they don't have anything milder (like I said, authentic). Funny enough this is they only thing I have had that seem's spicy, though everything is well seasoned. One thing that stand's out about their food is they seem to use less salt than any other Mexican Restaurant I have been to. You don't really notice how salty most Mexican food is until you come to a place like this that doesn't use as much. The lack of salt is actually a good thing, as it let's the natural flavors of the ingredients and seasoning's stand on their own. And heck, you can always add a little salt if you need it (though I have never felt the need here).\n\nI've tried quite a few things on the menu, and I have been impressed with almost everything. I am even more impressed considering their prices are excellent. Almost all their meals are less than $10, and burritos run for $6 or less. The two thing's that just astound me are that they have ceviche tostadas for $1.50 and tacos for $1.25. You can't find prices like that at Mexican fast food, let alone a sit down environment! And they have a ton of meat options for the tacos to; chorizo, asada, pastor, carnitas and chicken just to name a few. My wife and I almost always get a few tacos in addition to our meals every time we come here as they are very good and you just can't beat that price.\n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is anything with shredded beef in it, though I also love their chili verde. To be honest the only thing I ever had here that I didn't like is a torta with breaded steak, and even then the flavor was good it was just really chewy and tough. I also see a lot of people order soups, which I haven't tried myself but smell great and are served in large bowls. The next time we come here I plan on trying one.\n\nOne last thing, they have Mexican sodas and Mexican beers for great prices to. Sodas are $2 and beers are $3. Everything is served in glass bottles, and the coke is even in the larger size than the typical 12 ounce size. Yet another thing that adds to the authenticity of this establishment.\n\nIf you love really good authentic Mexican food, then you really need to give El Cordobes a try. This is one of those places that really stands above most of the rest.", "business_id": "ifkCEpYaSAUT3WVQNxwvXA", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-07-27", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "gOvUaiujBlICb8woURn-cg", "review_id": "sh_Wa8CVDsnKkMBwUF46Tw", "text": "I lunched here a few weeks ago and the food was great...but the service was less than stellar.

The service was excellent (which is hard to find in Vegas no matter where you go) and the food is much better than some of the higher end Italian restaurants in the city. They still have a passion for food and that is lacking in all of the chain restaurants. Even with the food being authentic they have figured out a way to keep their prices low and servings large. If you go to an Italian restaurant and like to fill up on unlimited soup and salad keep going to that spot, but if you want to fill your stomach with delicious sauces, meats, pastas and cheese try Giovanni's.
