We decided to dine-in.\n\nWe ordered egg rolls, I had the kung pao shrimp lunch special, and the husband had sesame chicken lunch special (for the lunch special you get fried rice, lo mein and a drink).  \n\nTo be honest the place looked like a dump. The walls were covered with food stains of some sort (looks like boogers). The chairs wobbles and the tables were chipped. Looks old and worn down. (if only I had seen all this before our food arrived) We were kind of worried that we might get food poisoning, but we took the risk. \n\nThe eggs rolls were okay, nice and hot, crispy on the outside, but for my taste very bland. The kung pao shrimp was okay, I expected to have more shrimp, but their were only about 6, their was some nice flavors. The rice and lo mein were also bland. They had some onions in the lo mein that tasted awful, which made the whole lo mein taste bad. The lo mein tasted so bad that I had to spit it out (I think the onions were old).\n\nThe sesame chicken was good. It was crispy on the outside and you get a whole bunch compared to the kung pao shrimp. Their was tons of sauce with the sesame chicken, no complaints there. But the husband did agree that the lo mein was pretty awful. \n\nThe service was good. The lady who took our order was friendly. Our food came out less than 10-15 minutes. \n\nThe question is, would we come back here again? No. Would we recommend the place? No.", "business_id": "KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-10-09", "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "mZRv579CnBtG--OheLP_bQ", "review_id": "70e0BLRI41Onkw_eXxhITQ", "text": "Pretty good!

I love Italian Beef & Italian sausage sandwiches. I'm down to try any Chicago style places. \n\nFirst time I went I got the spicy joe's sandwich, which is their version of Italian Beef with gardinier. It was served open face, and had plenty of gardinier on it. The one thing that I didn't like about it was that it was dry. I like my sandwiches dripping with the sauce. But, the flavor was good and the meat moist. \n\nThe second time I got the combo, which came with italian Sausage and beef. Beef was the same as last time, but the sausage definitely wasn't what I was expecting. It was a home made patty, but I had been looking forward to a traditional sausage. They had covered in marinara sauce, which i wouldn't have minded but the marinara sauce was super salty.\n\nService is good. The waitress was the same both times I went, and she was friendly. \n\nAlthough the food is only OK, it's the only place near me to get Chicago style food.

Not really a big deal, still there with plenty of time for me to get to work.\n\nMy most recent order, however, has been a complete nightmare. At 8:15 AM, there was no sign of my delivery, nor was there at 10:15, or at noon. I saw a couple of boxes on my neighbors porch, but I'm not through type and I don't go through other peoples mail. It turns out I should have. Mina finally got back to me, and said that the delivery driver told her that the packages have been delivered. I replied back, that there was nothing on my front porch and that had been home since 6 AM to see nothing delivered eight hours later. She then replied to me and said that her delivery driver returned and confirmed that the boxes were there, this time with a picture. By no coincidence, there was some shuffling outside of my door about five minutes prior but unfortunately I was in the bathroom and couldn't catch the delivery driver in the act. I attempted to call no less than two dozen times, but the number is automated and no one ever actually picks up. So I drove to the address listed on Google and on their website, only to find out that they haven't been there for sometime.

I've been really hesitant to because eating crawfish is so much work for so little reward, but my girl friends from Canada were in town and they love crawfish so I decided to take them.  Mind you, I WAS going to take them to Hot n Juicy first because everyone talks about it, but it was a 30-40 minute wait, we were all hungry....we weren't waiting.  So we headed over to Canjun Crawfish.  No wait, sat down right away.  You could tell it was a family own business, it was very odd atmosphere.  LCD screens throughout the place showing sports and other channels.  Paper menus like they printed out on their computer, but you know what?  Who cares! The food was awesome! 4 girls ate 10 lbs of food!\n3 lbs of canjun clams (mild, the shrimps are HUGE!) \n1 lb of shrimp house special (medium)\n6 lbs of crawfish (garlic butter - didn't have much taste) (2 lbs cajun mild) (3 lbs of house special medium)  the house special is canjun + Garlic butter.  \n\nA few days later i was craving crawfish at work so i googled the restaurant and found out they did take out, ordered it 15 minutes before I got off work, by the time I got there it was all ready for me.  \n\nAtmosphere isn't the greatest, but if you're with  bunch of good friends, who cares?  It doesn't have a dirty feel when you walk in.  You know how when you walk into some restaurants and you're just feel gross and everything just feels dirty?  Not this place at all.

Definitely looking forward to the next time.\n\n07/23/10:  Need to revise my stars and my review.  Went here with a bunch of friends that had never been.  My first experience was awesome, but this time was very disappointing.  Went with a group of 5 ppl, we sat down, ordered and waiting.  1 friend joined us a few minutes later and ordered.  Food starts to come out, the person that came late finally gets his order....the person sitting next to me looks around and says where's my food?  Called the waiter over and asked him where his order was.  Waiter says, you didn't order anything.  I made a comment, he sat down with us and I distinctively heard him ask how hot was the hot while he was ordering, how can you get the guy that walked in late's order but not his? He offered to put the order in right away, but my friend was already pissed.  One friend ordered the shrimp, it was way overcooked.  Mine didn't taste the same as it did the first time, so I called the waiter over and he said they changed the recipe to not be so soupy.  I was like but that's why I liked it?

The service was absolutely disappointing. The server (owner) took over 20 minuets to take our drink order.

I showed the other server lady because the owner once again wasn't around for another 20 minutes. She assured me the mug was clean just rubbed up against another mug. She acted like it was no big deal and like I was being picky. She asked if I wanted another I didn't want to wait another 10 minutes for a drink so I said no. Finally the owner came back to take our order. My mom ordered menudo, I ordered chicken enchiladas. The food came fast (about 10 minutes) my enchiladas were horrible. They were made from chicken scraps including chicken skin and all dark meat not breast at all. Iv never had enchiladas made from anything other than breast, even taco shops use breast meat. I showed the owner, she said they use chicken legs and no skin even though I was holding a piece of skin almost to her face. She said if I wanted breast they had items on the menu with breast. My mother was done with her meal by then. When I told her I didn't want anything she pick up the plate and rolled her eyes and walked away. I would never pay $12 for two enchiladas made from chicken legs. Another 10 minutes went by and still no check. My mom had to go to the register and ask for the check. The whole time the restaurant only had 5 table, they weren't that busy.\n\nWe spend $19 for menudo, a coffee and a horchata, I didn't drink.

I assumed these dishes were the chef's specialties, due to the name of the plate, but apparently the chef took the night off.  The relleno was a combo of dry chicken inside a dry coating that tasted like a dry biscuit with no cheese and very little sauce which was also bland. The seafood enchilada was supposed to have shrimp, crab and orange roughy, but it only had shrimp and was boooooring with very little sauce and no cheese. The carnitas taco was the least offensive, but the carnitas was also very dry and didn't have much flavor on its own. The rice and beans were bland and boring. I didn't realize that Mexican food could get this dull. I even had to ask for more salsa so I could counteract the dryness enough to get the food down.

The first two times my hubby and I had pizza and wings.  The wings are good (well good for Las Vegas), meaning they are a decent size, they aren't dripping in grease, and when you order hot, they are actually kind of hot.  The pizza is really good as well.  We have tried the cheese pizza (which is a great deal, a large cheese for $8!  Cheaper than Walmart!) and the Rustica Pizza (roasted red peppers, chicken, artichokes).  The delivery was fast, it only took them like 30 minutes when they told me 45.\n\nToday we actually went in to eat.  I ordered the Penne a la vodka and a Caesar salad, my mom had the chicken sorrentino (chicken breast topped with eggplant and mozz) and a house salad, my hubby had the chicken philly, and my dad had the sausage and pepper sandwich.  We were all happy with the food.  \n\nThe salads were a good size portion and you could probably spit them between two people.  I LOVED the Caesar salad because the dressing was homemade, therefore it was REAL Caesar dressing.  You could taste the garlic and it had just a hint of anchovy flavor, totally brought me back to my childhood.  The house salad was a mixed green salad with some tomatoes and balsamic vinegar (for only $3, I think that is cheaper than Mickey Ds) and my mom really liked it.  The salads came with these yummy homemade rolls that were hot out of the oven.  The Penne a la vodka was delicous, very creamy and tasty and there was so much of it, I will be having it for dinner later tonight.  The chicken sorrentino was also a good size portion chicken breast served on top of linguine, my mom took half of hers home.  The sandwiches were a decent size and my dad (I consider him an expert in sausage and peppers since it is one of his signature dishes), really enjoyed the sandwich.

The employees were all very friendly.\n\nMy only complaint is that the pizza was pretty average.

My first thought, 9.99 for AYCE !?!?! what a freakin deal.  Of course there had to be a catch.  The AYCE menu for lunch is limited to crappy california rolls to more variations of a california roll.  You can practically get NOTHING with fish in it.   They do however let you have the option of ordering your normal sushi for 1.00 an order, not a bad business idea i suppose but it definitely does not leave you satisfied.\n\nMY LAST experience was for another dinner AYCE.  Let me first start with my first order.  I began to list out all the items that I wanted.  \"3 super white, 3 garlic tuna, 3 salmon 3........ BAM interrupted.  The waitress said she'll put this order in first and just walked away.  In my head, \"aren't you writing this down? is it that hard to remember\"  Then she comes back and tells us that we should take our time since its the AYCE is not timed.  ok, I get it, we shouldnt hurry, fine.  So we wait and wait and finish our first plate which was very quick.  Then attempt to order again.  Same thing again, but this time, we only ordered 2 items.\n\nOk, i think i can gauge how much i freakin eat lady, i understand that business is bad since no one was there but you can you NOT tell me how much food i can freakin order since its AYCE.  \n\nTHE WORST PART, and on top of everything, each piece of sushi, and including the roll i ordered was PACKED with rice.  we order a yellow tail jalepeno type roll with some sauce which essentially was LARGE AMOUNTS OF RICE WITH SOY SAUCE, and a itty bitty piece of fish.  I would not be complaining if the amount of rice in the roll WASN'T OUTRAGEOUS. \n\nAfter eating my meal i just wanted to scream, STOP BEING SO CHEAP !@#J!K@#!@, unfortunately i may have to come back here to get my mayor-ship/dukedom back on foursquare and yelp *sigh how sad....", "business_id": "VFVyecs0nMFA4xizXkzvKA", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-01-12", "useful": 4, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "6A1KvY0sqirf-8zyjNbHzg", "review_id": "lUaMKUEcEGgGYA72P8Hc1A", "text": "We ordered the lamb shawarma plates (for a mere $8.95 each) tonight for take-out after my brother recommended this place.

The nachos were satisfying, $8 for any meat choice - we had carne asada and it was very tasty and a large portion.

There were probably 80-100 people there, and it was a good friendly crowd.   The dance floor is so large that there was no problem for everyone to fit.  Throughout the evening, the DJ organized some dance games and contests, and I noticed that it was easy for people who arrived alone to join in and even be asked to dance in partner songs.  The music was heavy on the salsa, with a little merengue, bachata and cumbia.  It's also notable that this venue is totally smoke-free.  \n\nI can imagine that this place would be a little dead during the day - even with the 100 people there when I visited, there were *tons* of open tables left.

I recently found a great Cuban one in the Northwest called Varadero that needs our support as the strip mall it's in isn't what you'd call bustling.\n\nIt's hard to find good Cuban food in Vegas, and sadly we've lost a few of the better Cuban restaurants to the recession. I generally go to Havana Cafe on Eastern, but as much as I enjoy it I can't really say it's frugal. Varadero is frugal, however, and the food is just as good, if not better.\n\nI'm itching to try more on the menu because both times I've gone everything has been just delicious. The traditional black bean soup is well done ($2.25), but a more interesting soup is the Crema Aurora, a cream based tomato and cheese concoction ($2.95). The heavy \"soup\" is actually more reminiscent of a dip, which paired wonderfully with the complimentary toasted Cuban garlic bread.\n\nThe Ropa Vieja ($10.75), meaning \"torn clothes,\" was better than any I can remember having had. The rich, tomato based broth was reduced to perfect gravy consistency, and the shredded beef was tender without being mushy. Another highlight was the Arroz con Pollo ($10.95). It consisted of a juicy roasted half chicken hidden under a bed of creamy, saffron colored Cuban risotto. Both entrees came with maduros, or sweet fried plantains, and moros y cristianos, black beans and white rice cooked together. The latter wasn't done as well as at Havana Cafe but the maduros were as good as you can get.\n\nFor the prices and food quality you can't beat Varadero for Cuban food.

For eight bones, you cant go wrong.\n\nSelections included; shrimp ceviche; mole; chile verde; hominy soup; and cheesy roasted potato skins, amongst a handful of other more ordinary dishes.

The pork chile verde was probably my favorite.\n\nDessert wasn't as impressive as the flan was mediocre at best. There was also something that reminded me of a caramel turtle pie.

They even serve Pho, which is already quite out of place, but they didn't even have it available when we were there. \n\nWe came here the day after their grand opening and more than half their menu wasn't available to order.

The size of one pot looks like it wouldn't be enough for even one person, and they were charging $6 for it. Tony's review is correct, it literally looks like they just mixed up the rice with some meat, added some sauce and oil, then put it in the claypot. There were no crisp burnt rice sticking against the pot ().\n\nWe also ordered beef dry chow fun, which was ok tasting, but lacked the \"wok air\" ().

When i asked \"is this really a large?\" The dude laughed and it seemed he mocked me by saying - \" Extra large!\" I was like - yeah ok. \nThe wings sucked, I have had beef jerkey that was better. They were NOT BBQ flavored, they just had a brown sauce on them,... If i had to guess, I'd say they forgot what flavor I ordered and just gave me mild whatever. Duno how they forgot my wing flavor, I was the only customer there. Oh yeah no ranch or blue cheese either, was not surprised.

I expected so much more because my brother and his gf kept talking about this place and liked it more than Island Sushi, which is still my FAVORITE sushi joint in Vegas right now. So we had a Friday night AYCE. It was a party of 6 and we got there around.. 7:30p.\n\nIt was scary quiet for a sushi place that is supposed to be amazing. I think at the time we got there, there was 2 other tables. During the time that we were there, there was about 3 more tables in and out. And with 2 servers, 2 chefs, and only 3 other tables besides ours (with only 2 ppl at each table), the service was very disappointing.\n\nThe sushi came out very slowly. They got our nigiri orders wrong. Our sushi rolls took about half an hour. The only food that arrived quickly was the deep fried soft shell crab (limit 1 per person) but that was really good! But each order is 2 small pieces. It seems like it was premade, but oh well. We also got the baked mussels, which were okay, definitely have had better.\n\nThey have a great selection of items of their menu, with amaebi, uni, lobster rolls, etc. But maybe the slow service made me not enjoy my food. And it wasn't \"wow\" or anything.\n\nThe fish is pretty fresh and the rolls were a decent size.\n\nI believe this place used to be Yummy Sushi... but not sure. I used to LOVE yummy sushi for lunch. They made great smoothies. But Kan Pai didn't offer any.\n\nSo other items we ordered: Baked Lobster Roll (yummy! but limited orders), deep fried lobster roll, also yummy. Spider roll - not what we expected at all... it was wrapped in a green wrap thing rather than seaweed. Johnny roll - fresh fish wrapped in cucumber, i liked it. Cherry Blossom - not a roll, basically crab meat wrapped in avocado (also limited quantity), but nothing special. Also had some other rolls, everything was pretty fresh, but nothing that great. Full of sauce.\n\nAmaebi - they deep fried the heads, which were yummy. Uni - the first thing that we ordered but didn't get until about 45minutes later, and they didn't give us a full order and when we asked, they said they ran out, but failed to mention that when they brought the order to our table. We also ordered 8 orders of sake with the uni and only received half the order. We ended up ordering so many things because we never received certain things and other ordered got f'd up. Overall, not a great experience.\n\nThe servers were nice, but barely spoke english. The sushi chefs were too busy drinking with the guest at the bar... the best thing about this place, unlimited dessert (tempura ice cream, green tea ice cream, and red bean ice cream.)\n\nSo its the average sushi place, that's it.

The broth had been thickened with too much starch and had very little flavor besides salt.

It did all seem quite fresh, but the only thing I liked was my refreshing slush.  I had not realized when I ordered it that the twice cooked pork was actually pork belly.  Perhaps this was my fault, but neither my guest or I liked it.  The sauce was rather good, but the fat was too tough to bite through.\nThe Mongolian Beef, a dish I have had many versions of, was the worst iteration yet.  There was a lot of onion that had barely touched the wok, it was so raw and the sauce was quite sweet and thick as though it came straight out of a bottle.  This was served with some fried rice that had an unpleasant flavor.\nThe wings were not bad,  the coating was crispy and fried just right.

We started with the papads, which were tasty but didn't come with any chutney (surprising).  The mains followed with saag chicken, fish curry, dal makhni, egg curry, upma, jeera rice, raita and garlic naan.  We felt like everything had been lovingly prepared, it just had that homemade taste.   The stand out dish for me was the egg curry - just fantastic and kind of hard to find on menus at Indian restaurants in the US.   My husband and friend thought the fish curry was number one, with a fresh tomato taste.  Only one downside, the naan was just so-so - kind of tasted like the frozen supermarket naan that they doctored up with garlic and cilantro.  \nTo drink, we all ordered fresh lime juices, which were a perfect accompaniment to the foods.  The restaurant is working on getting their liquor license within the next few months.   In addition to the great food, there was live entertainment with a jazz trio, and singing done by the owner/chef.

They asked me how about this place... I was hesitate at first, since I didn't hear much great things, but when my mother told me all my relatives from Korea LOVED this place when they visited Vegas for my cousin's wedding... that changed everything. My mother goes.. have you even tried their food??!! I said Nooo, but heard it wasn't good. Then she goes.. how You know that if you never tried this place yet??!?!! Good point...\n\nThat being said... we went in and the owner recognized my Father. My father goes.. you remember me?? The owner goes... yes of course!!! The story behind this was.. when my relatives from Korea were in town.. they literally came here every single day for two weeks. They Loved their soups and thought it was better than Tofu Hut. The owner even gave my uncle a free bottle of soju when he ate there.. If you don't know about my uncle.. he drinks soju... in the morning, afternoon, evening, and even late night!! It's a Korean tradition back home I swear!!!\n\nWe all ordered their Oxknee Soup.. which is #5 on the top list of food picture you see on the right side when you walk in or in the menu book .. under Soup.. it's #3 called Beef Knee Bone Soup. If you like tendons, the chewy muscles... this will be your favorite soup to have. My parents say this soup is the best from all the others. The broth is milky, beige from all the slow cooking from the bones of the meats. It's so soothing and tasty. I loved it!!! I added tons of sliced green onion and a tablespoon of salt, but you can determine how much you want. The tendons were soft, jelly-like chewy texture... only a few were somewhat firm in chewing. If the pieces are too big to put in your mouth, there's a scissor to cut it in pieces.. which is also used for the two types of kimchi they give you. One is napa cabbage and the other is daikon radish... it comes in two thick dark jars and an endless amount of kimchi to your hearts desire!!! There's a separate dish, where you place the kimchi's to cut into pieces and add to the soup or eat as a condiment. They first bring out six complimentary pieces of deep fried zucchini.. then the kimchi. We were also given a jalapeno, daikon, and diced onion marinated in soy sauce to eat on the side with the soup.\n\nThe daikon radish kimchi was perfectly fermented that it had a great crunch and crisp, fresh taste to it. My mother commented on how good it was. They also give you a sauce to dip the tendons in, which consist of soy sauce and hot mustard.. you mix it together and dip the tendon or should I say coat the tendon in and eat it with the bowl of rice... sip the broth of the soup after and it all goes down so well. Delicious, soothing, and perfect for a cold winter night or day!\n\nThey provide barley tea and at the end.. you get a free cup of cold, refreshing sweet rice drink for dessert. It also helps with digestion my mother pointed out. Great way to wash everything down and even in Winter, it was so invigorating to drink. Loveloveloved it!!! \n\nThis place is right across the street, adjacent to Cafe Moda and in the same complex of 168 Market. It has brown brick walls and a red sign on top of the restaurant. The sign is written in Korean, so don't bother looking for E-Jo at all. They have about eight tables inside and a tv that has some korean drama playing. I didn't think much of this place from the reviews I read, but this place ended up to be such a delightful surprise. They are known for their soups and tasty broth. Service was great and the soup was therapeutic. It stayed hot for a long while, since the pot kept the heat in the soup and even after.. the broth stayed perfectly warm to just sip through. My father told me when you eat this soup, you won't get hungry for a long time. It was very filling, but in a good way. It just relaxes you... I guess you really can't judge a place by a few bad reviews. You need to come here and try it yourself or at least with someone that knows what's good here.

When we walked in the place was nothing special and no one greeted us or sat us at a table.

We asked him about the lunch special that was clearly posted on the outside window but he had no idea what it included.  \n\nWe should've just left then, but I wanted to use the Groupon that I purchased and would probably not be on this side of town any time soon.

She brought us drinks and never came back until the food was done.  Both the appetizer and the main dish were both greasy and bland.  The food was definitely not anything to return for.  We waited and waited for refills on our drinks but the waitress never returned and we had to go get the attention of someone out of the kitchen to get our drinks refilled. \n\nI didn't think things could get worse, but once the bill came they did!  I showed the waitress the Groupon voucher on my phone (like I have been doing at numerous establishments for the past two years) and she had no idea what I was trying to show her.  She immediately got rude with me and asked me \"who sent that to you??\". I tried to explain how Groupon works, since she obviously lives under a rock, but she just acted like I was being ridiculous and giving her some kind of \"fake\" coupon.  When I finally made her understand that my phone was the actual voucher, she was even more rude than before.  Her exact words were \"what am i supposed to do with that?! How am i supposed to scan it??? THIS ISN'T A GROCERY STORE!!\" Wooooow! I couldn't believe my ears. How could she talk to me like that just because SHE didn't know what to do??

She just kept telling me that \"they don't use that company any more\" and \"I don't think we can take that\".  She refused to even deal with me and my stupid phone coupon.  I had to pay the entire bill and was unable to use my Groupon.  \n\nThe service was horrible even before I presented the coupon and it got 10 times worse after, I would not recommend this place to anyone!

Our search for this place felt like an episode of  Lord of the Rings:  Following signs, backtracking, splitting up and meeting again, etc.  We had a great advantage over the hobbits in that we had our cell phones to keep in touch.  Furthermore, we could stop and rest along the way with booze, food, and of course craps.  Those poor little hobbits...\n\nOur 8 person party was escorted to a table through a labyrinth of small rooms/anterooms and seated for dinner.  We drank like fish, ate lots of fish and chips, and enjoyed the band.  It was for the most part a great bar band, the kind you often see in Vegas if you're just walking around.  It was a little jarring to have to leave the nice dark wood and dim lighting of the pub to go out into the casino and find the restroom, but we all survived.  \nUnless you're already out in Green Valley for some reason, I can't imagine any great reason to hit this place.  However if you are already in the building, it's a decent place to drink.  They also show lots of Rugby, Premier League, and other European/International sporting events at the usual early morning time if you're so inclined.", "business_id": "WKbfG_4203Kn__5rHFk9Gg", "stars": 3, "date": "2007-06-20", "useful": 7, "cool": 9}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "XV0_DoNj27oA5ofCC0ZfOQ", "review_id": "3Qxp9H1QvLqrIUGp2JIwTA", "text": "Didn't like the crawfish since they told us it was frozen but the shrimp was great!!! also we enjoyed the chicken strip.  suprise there weren't that many customer.

The only thing keeping this from a 5-star burger is the bread.  It's YUMMY and toasted as it should be, but it's just too thick.  You have to get at least a double to have any hope of balance.  Triple would be best, but that's too much food for most folks.  Get a single, lose the bottom bun and just roll it and eat it with the top.  :)  I'm REALLY happy to have found this place.

A grilled cheese truck?  Isn't grilled cheese one of the first things we all learn to cook ourselves when we're children?  And as we grew up, we threw more than just cheese into our sandwiches?  For me, a grilled cheese sandwich is a clean slate where you open up your cupboards and refrigerator, see what random veggies and meats you have, and throw them into your own creation.  Pickles, chips, bacon, tomato and whatever was laying around and doing a bad job at getting eaten.  Why would I pay someone else to make me a grilled cheese sandwich?\n\nBecause, unlike Muncheeze, I don't have what amounts to Pulled Porky (Slidin' Thru) ingredients in my refrigerator.  That, and my curiosity had to be quenched; this is the sister truck to Slidin' Thru after all.  I ordered $10 The Munchbox Combo (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=mpiJd-Oce51nSrAv40SWsw), which includes:\n\n-Any sandwich; I went with the Piggy Mac (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=kzXgIx3n3pYd6YEX23Jobg): pulled pork with jalape\u00f1o, bacon, mac&cheese and BBQ sauce.  Think Pulled Porky slider with mac & cheese.  The one ingredient that fell short of expectations to me was the mac & cheese; it had that re-heated consistency where the macaroni appears to have absorbed the gooey cheese that you have when it is fresh.  I also don't think it's plausible to have a fresh batch of mac & cheese made for each sandwich, though.\n\n-Six Mac Bites (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=YP__n0J35JtAdi4DlcdPOg): Little macaroni & cheese poppers that comes with a \"holla-peno ketchup.\"  It was marinara sauce with a slight zing to it.  The bites themselves (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw?select=VeHYtE8SFymSQHZrRjCKIA) suffered from the same critique I had of the macaroni & cheese in the Piggy Mac.\n\n-A drink; I got a 700ml bottle of water.\n\nIf you go strictly by the menu pricing, the Munchbox combo saves you a dollar: $6 sandwich + $3 Mac Bites + $2 drink.  If you go by execution I think it falls a little short; I was hoping for more cheese!  A gooey Piggy Mac that struggled to stay together because the macaroni was swimming in cheese!  Mac Bites that burned the roof of my mouth with cheesy macaroni!  Maybe I was just a hungry kid that grew up putting way too much kids in my sandwiches.  But that is what I was hoping for.\n\nEither way I will be returning to the truck.  I gotta try the Tomato Soup and Lobster Bisque; maybe even the Chi Chi and Sassperilla.  As for their Piggy Mac?  I'm honestly tempted to take home some Porky sliders and pair it up with some fresh mac & cheese for a homemade Piggy Mac...

I'd be one of the first to say that you're usually not going to find anything truly special on wheels, with a few notable exceptions of course, so I'm not that I'd never heard of them until i saw the lineup of a new weekly food truck event that I was planning to visit. After trying the food, I became very surprised indeed.\n\nThe highlight of their menu of \"Barcelona Inspired Street Food\" (you'll see the words on both sides of the truck) is actually a separate blackboard full of Iberico ham options (Jamon Iberico \"de Bellota\" to boot, which is reputedly the highest qualtiy). The gentleman outside the truck pointed out this menu while I stared pensively at the truck, and the chef went so far as to offer me a sample.\n\nI will admit that I have certainly never had Iberico before, so I have no point of comparison, but the morsel of meat that the chef offered me was the best thinly sliced ham that I have ever had the pleasure to taste - far richer than whatever prosciuttos that I've eaten (laugh at me all you want, but I'm not that well-traveled or experienced). Consequently, I had to order off their Iberico menu, whether or not the pig that this came from actually ingested acorns and only acorns all of its life.\n\nI chose the Flat Bread of Iberico ($12), which was simply the ham draped on a flatbread, with some tomato and olive oil in between. I already waxed poetic about the ham, but the bread was surprisingly good, certainly far better than whatever run-of-the-mill pitas that every Greek place uses. The tomato was a welcome acidic accent, but perhaps slightly overpowering in some bites. Still, I'd definitely suggest ponying up for either this or really any of their other options if they offer what they call Iberico.\n\nI was also hungry enough to order the Barcelona Sausage ($8.50), a non-encased pork sausage in a buttery roll with zucchini sprouts and chimichurri mojo verde. I really have to highlight the awesome roll, which is by far the best bread that I've had from a food truck and certainly one of the better ones if I include brick-and-mortar. They actually source it from local outfit Great Buns Bakery, but whether it's the third-party softness and airiness or the chef's grill treatment, you can't miss their bocatas (aka bocadillos, aka sandwiches) for this reason alone.\n\nThe sausage needed to shine too - heck, it's the namesake - and it indeed had a rich, meaty flavor. It kinda reminded me a bit of bratwurst, actually. The accompaniments are also nice, including some chips (taro?) that were somewhat prone to falling off but still delivered a touch of crunchiness. I'll likely also grab another bocata next time to see what else they have to offer.\n\nBy the way, both portion sizes are what I'd charmingly call \"modest.\" But with food trucks, you're often prone to paying prices not too much lower for food that's certainly inferior. Same for brick-and-mortar places, sometimes. Go for quality over quantity here and then pig out on whatever gut bombs you might find at other trucks at events.\n\nAs food trucks often do, Boqueria Street posts their menu on their various social media pages, as well as their web site (which also has a copy of the menu, sin* Iberico). That's how you'll find them, and you definitely should make the effort to try one of the best food trucks in town and one of the more interesting new food ventures, four-wheeled and four-walled alike.\n\n[*because not everyone learns at least sufficient Spanish to get by, sin = sans = without - capisce?]", "business_id": "xAhB_i6-799TakpGqVplWw", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-03-24", "useful": 8, "cool": 6}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "SWzl3C3-3R-TcOGGfV4X4g", "review_id": "_HQ1HC4ioHEttJURpdktlA", "text": "Unfortunately JC was injured on the job which forced him to close his doors.

There were a lot of dishes that sounded great but we didn't order them since it was just my wife and I.  Speaking of the 2 of us, we were also the only ones in the entire restaurant from 5:30-7:00pm.  Thanks to Mike C. for his review because I wouldn't have known of this place and apparently no one else does either.  \n\nIt's a pretty big place, the furniture and atmosphere are nice.  I think this used to be a teppenyaki place based on how they've creatively redesigned the designated area where past chefs flung egg shells into their hats.  They also have a little bar area.  We chose to sit in the smaller room off to the side since they had a TV showing baseball.  The music was mainly K-pop with Britney and Taylor Swift thrown into the mix.  \n\nThe menu is separated into \"traditional\" and \"modern\" sections.  Some modern dishes that popped out for me were the seared beef belly salad and caramelized sea scallop that I'll save for a future trip.  We ended up going with one of their sets called \"Amber\".  There are 4 sets to choose from and they consist of 2 dishes and 2 beers that accompany those plates well.  So \"Amber\" came with 2 bottles of Sam Adams plus the \"Crispy Bulgogi\" and \"Tofu Kimchi\".  We also got an order of the fried chicken because the photos of it looked so damn good and that was the first thing our server recommended.  \n\nTheir \"Tofu Kimchi\" was pretty spicy and my favorite dish.  The menu description was unfair since it only said \"soft tofu, kimchi, pork\" so I was just expecting a bowl of everything mixed but the thin individually sliced pieces of tofu then topped with a good portion of pork and spiced up kimchi made for a tasty surprise.  I initially thought that was going to be the most boring dish we ordered but that turned out to be the \"Crispy Bulgogi\" which wasn't really even that crispy and pretty dry.  The fried chicken was awesome.  The pieces were all dark meat, perfectly fried with crisp outsides and juicy insides.  The dressing that it came with was really good too.  \n\n9 on the Plate would probably be a raging success if it were located on Spring Mountain but it might be a tall order in this shopping plaza even though Sen of Japan is also there.

(No slam on NY-style; it just isn't my thing.)

Was I just unlucky on the second visit?\n\nThese questions in my mind, there's another problem. As noted in another review, they have started slipping into gated apartment complexes and spamming the residents with their fliers. I'm of the school that just because everyone else does it, that doesn't make littering and (essentially) trespassing acceptable.

We were using Chinatown as a meet up destination and just so happen to see the huge \"Lunch Special\" Banner hanging outside.  After walking around the premises and looking at our dining options, we opted to go with Kung Fu Chef.\n\nPros:\n  * LARGE MENU SELECTION & PRICING:\n  There were tons of choices and all at very reasonable prices.  Lo Mein & Fried Rice of all variations ranged in price from $4.99 - $8.99.  They also have options in Clay Pot dishes, Seafood, and even the ever-so-popular Pho.  There were some menu items that I've never seen before too:  Salt Fish Sausages, Brine Duck Tongue, and Lamb On A Stick (just to name a few).  I even mentioned that Andrew Zimmern would probably take a liking to this place.  If my memory serves me correctly, Lunch specials started at $4.99.  I didn't get any of the specials, but there are definitely some appealing options worth considering for those that are dining on a budget.\n\n *  ATMOSPHERE:\n  The atmosphere was very well-lit and the dining area itself was very large in size.  They had tables large enough for bigger parties (just in case you were wondering).  Due to the excessive floor space, seating did not feel congested... this is always a good thing.  One weird thing though is that the restaurant appeared to be split into 2 different sections.. I think it's just due to the layout of the floor.\n\n*  SERVICE\n  Our server was very nice and informative when we had questions about the menu and menu items.  She provided us with recommendations and was very patient with us when we were trying to decide on what to order.\n\nCons:\n*  SERVICE\n  Yes, the service was good when we received it, but they never really checked back on us.  I felt that the Tea served in ceramic tea cups was good, but Jade felt it was bland in taste.  We were dying for some ice water ,but had to wave someone down to get it.  I'm not sure if the server would bring the bill to our table so after a few minutes of waiting, I ended up going to the register and waiting there to pay.  \n\n*  STEW BEEF & RADISH HOT POT\n  Let me first say that this Hot Pot dish is new to me, but we figured we'd venture out and try something out of the ordinary from out typical picks.  Maybe this is one of those that require acquired taste buds, but whatever it is, this did not taste appetizing.  I figured, maybe its just me, but Jade felt the same way.  We ended up barely touching it and trying to stomach what we did have.  I'm not a fan of this particular dish.\n\nOrdered:\n*  SALT & PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS:  The menu reads \"Fried Chicken Wings\", but when I ordered it the server said: \"you are talking about salt and pepper chicken wings right?\"  So I answered \"yes\".  There is salt and pepper squid on the menu, but anyhow...  These were really good.  I loved the crunchiness and the whatever they used to season it was very appetizing.  There are 10 wings that come out stacked high on a bed of lettuce.  This is definitely something I'd get again.\n\n*  STEW BEEF & RADISH HOT POT: Read above for my opinion on this.\n\n* CHICKEN DRY FRIED RICE NOODLE:  This was very good as well.  The sauce wasn't too overpowering.  You have an option of Shrimp or Chicken on the menu, but I decided on the Chicken.  It is served A La Carte and there is plenty for 2 to share this dish.  The pieces of chicken were cut larger than what I am usually used to, but I'm not complaining.  I'd recommend this dish.\n\nOverall:\n  *  Although, I had a bad experience with Stew Beef & Radish Hot Pot, I must say everything else that we ordered was on point.  The selection of food and prices were very competitive and the portion of food was on the larger side.  I'd definitely come to this place again.\n\nTips:\n *  If you are in the mood for some Slush drinks, they have a variety to choose from on the back on the menu ($3.95 each):   Red Bean, Papaya, Lychee, and Pineapple Slush to name a few.  \n *  There is tons of parking in the back if the parking lot is full.\n *  For $11.95, they have a LAMB HOT POT SOUP and we were told it's actually served with a flame under it (I'm assuming like Tom Yum).  I have no idea if it's good or not.  I'm just throwing it out there for anyone interested.", "business_id": "MMvrkQsrZJviAz2sLd_voQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-03-13", "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g", "review_id": "tSWURJaagYNxfZeZySzRcw", "text": "This is a very tough review for me to write. On our trip to Pyaar the one good thing I can say about the restaurant is the owners are some of the nicest and most accommodating people you could hope to meet. Unfortunately, I really didn't like my meal here.\n\nIt should also be noted that this is a review ONLY of the dinner buffet - it's possible that ala carte menu ordering will produce a different experience.\n\nAnyway, when my wife and I discovered a new Indian restaurant was opening in town we were pleased, but the news that this one would feature an Indian DINNER buffet had us over the moon. We are night owls by nature and during vacation times or on weekends we aren't always ready to go in time for a lunch buffet - the chance of a dinner option for Indian buffet sounded perfect.\n\nTonight we went in with no expectations. $9.99 or so per person for dinner seemed like a good deal, although we were surprised that Naan had to be purchased separately (it's usually included with the buffet - this is the first time i've seen it as an extra).\n\nThe selection was small and I ran into immediate problems. I'm not sure if this is synonymous with the particular cuisine Pyaar aims at - they claim to me \"The only North-South-Mogul Indian restaurant in Vegas\" - but I was surprised at the presence of a couple of beef dishes, the lack of any real \"main\" dish for vegetarians and nothing at all with the nice sauces I've come to expect from Indian food. \n\nNo Paneer dish, no Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Makhani, no samosas, no pakora, no kofta of any sort.  What I ended up with was the only two tandoori chicken drumsticks, some of the very wet \"chilli beef\" some of the vegetable curry and a lot of rice.\n\nThe tandoori chicken was fine if unspectacular and I'd have been OK to eat that and write it off as a \"notch in the belt\" but not somewhere I wanted to visit again, but unfortunately the rest of the tandoori was thighs which I don't like. The chilli beef tasted like a generic beef stew with a bit of chilli powder added, potatoes were OK-ish but a bit hard in the vegetable curry.\n\nMy vegetarian wife fared even worse than me - ending up with some chick peas and a bit of potato on top of a bed of basmati rice.\n\nBy the time our Naan (which tasted like a flour tortilla) arrived I realised that I had nothing to mop up as there was no dish featuring any of the delicious gravies I have come to associate with Indian food.\n\nAround 3 minutes into the meal my wife pretended to receive an urgent phone call and we apologised and asked for the check. The owners felt bad for us and were extremely nice, offering to let us fill up to go boxes from the buffet and they waived the cost of the Naan. \n\nNow, perhaps it's a different type of Indian cuisine and it's just our personal taste, but we really didn't like the buffet here at all. I feel bad having to pan this place so harshly because I really liked the owners, but I hope if they read this review they consider some changes to their buffet because right now it's uninspired bordering on inedible.", "business_id": "VNOz_tOw_Hz3FAJeEHb_yg", "stars": 1, "date": "2010-06-29", "useful": 6, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g", "review_id": "cVb6ipeYcr_edXNrKOSUTg", "text": "UGH.\n\nSome of the two star reviews are being far too kind to this place.

They're sandwiched (appropriately) between TIABI and Sakana in a fairly small strip mall on Maryland Parkway. \n\nMy eyes lit up when I first saw porchetta on the menu photo. It's not a common if at all available pork preparation in this town (or at least as far as Yelp reviews have cataloged it). After I checked with a friend and received confirmation that it's awesome, I beelined there for lunch, finding the place fortunately (for me) not very busy.\n\nAfter seeing the rotisserie at work right behind the counter, with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes both filling drip trays below the porchetta, I decided that I should go pick one of those as a side. Fearing a potential food coma, I kept it light by picking the Brussels sprouts ($4), which appropriately came out at the same time as the sandwich. I wouldn't outright call them mushy, but they're on the soft side and had no crunch. Also, the portion on this was a bit modest for the price. At least the Brussels sprouts are subtly tasty, likely owing to the porchetta drippings.\n\nThe owner was offering sample cups of Cilantro Chicken Soup ($5) while people waited for their orders. After tasting it, I almost had to order one to-go. It's balanced in seasoning and thickness, and the chicken was so tender that you don't even have to hear the owner say that the soup is made fresh daily. Plus, the bowl is quite generously sized.\n\nI did bury the lede a bit, and that's the brilliant Porchetta Sandwich ($12). I was worried that the \"French baguette\" bread would be tough if not outright sharp, but it was simply a delicious and chewy container for the goodness within. That treasure starts with awesome porchetta, including juicy pork loin and the crispy skin of the belly, the latter an unparalleled textural experience. The lemon sauce (with herbs) complements everything perfectly, and the fresh arugula completes the Italian-inspired experience. It doesn't get too messy compared to some sandwiches.\n\nThe porchetta alone earns Karved a top rating in my book, and the chicken soup was memorable enough for me to overlook the Brussels sprouts. Hopefully, I'll be free to come back soon to try some of their other options, including that yet-to-be-explored tri-tip.", "business_id": "cePE3rCuUOVSCCAHSjWxoQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-11-07", "useful": 13, "cool": 8}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "BuPih71V_cZt2vGpgNyRwQ", "review_id": "wZTRL_tkaPD3zhnzr6sUbA", "text": "First off let me start by saying I cant believe this place is in business.

As im watching them all take shots im wondering to myself how long im going to have to sit here and wait. To my surprise the guy standing at the bar taking shots was the manager! Wow. Classy!! He slugged over with what seemed to be a carefree attitude as if I interrupted and inconveinced him. All that was said was.\" We'll take care of it\" they took off one drink and sent over a complimentary drink as if giving me alcohol was going to fix it.. pathetic.! All in all very poor management, rude, and seems as if they dont take their position seriously.  I would not recommend going at all!

Not only is the food not fresh, it looks like it has been there for hours upon hours. The sauces on the food were dried up. I went around 5pm if that helps anyone.\n\nThey had a pretty good selection of dishes, but everything was bland and tasted like the worst buffet ever, let me rephrase that, the worst Asian food ever.  Do they not taste their food before putting it out?\n\nNot everything was bad, they did have a few good things, like the stuffed mushrooms and crab stuffed oysters, nothing too memorable.\n\n\nThe SERVICE:\nNow some more complaints. The workers seem to have never worked as a server before, no refills for our entire meal.  I can't believe this!  I would understand if the place was actually busy, but I swear they only had 5 tables sat and 2 servers working.  One of the guy servers literally looked like he was trying to sleep standing up.  What is this your father's store?\n\n\nThe RESTROOM:\nFucking disgusting!  I walked in there and looked around and washed my hands.  I swear it felt like my hands got dirtier.  The toilet was horrible, like an outside gas station toilet that has never been cleaned.  A used toilet seat cover still on the toilet and probably fresh diarrhea in the toilet.  God does anyone work in this place?\n\n\nLast but not least.  The meal was around $28 for 3 people after tax.  I gave the lady $20 in cash and told her to put the rest on a card.  For some genius ass reason this lady decides that she deserves a $6 tip and takes the cash and charges the other 50% of the check on the card.  WTF is this?  Ok, I would have no problem tipping this bitch if she refilled my drink once, but to think she deserves anything more than $2 for the service I received is bullshit.

Really made me miss living in the South.\n\nI ordered the 4-bone dish which is 4 beef ribs and two sides and your choice of type of bread.  I got greens and mac & cheese as my two sides and white bread.  While I was waiting for the food, I realized I was sitting next to the owner at the next table.  He was eating chicken and watching a football game on the mounted TV they have.  I watched the game with him and we both commented on some of the plays.  \n\nWhen the ribs came I was surprised at how much meat was on the bones.  They were pretty good.  I ate two without the BBQ sauce and the other two without.  The meat's just good enough to eat without the sauce.  It's got good solid flavor and there can be a lot of fat on parts of the meat.  The BBQ sauce is a little disappointing.  It's sweet without a whole lot of flavor.  I prefer my BBQ sauce with a lot of herbs to bring out the taste in ribs.  I wasn't sure whether they made their own sauce or not and forgot to ask.\n\nThe greens were ok, nothing great.  The mac & cheese were absolutely spot on though.  I was amazed.

Other places skimp on the red  pepper mixture leaving theirs bland, sometimes sweet, and lacking of flavor. Not at E-Jo. They do it right by opening each leaf and spreading in this magical combination. It is a tedious process, but that's how good kimchi is made.

I gotta say, this place is a real dive, but the staff are friendly and the food is cheap-to-moderately priced. \n\nWe ordered the \"garlic balls\" appetizer just because the name was too funny to pass them up.  I did not like them AT ALL. They were just balls of bread with possibly olive oil on them, and they tasted of garlic powder, not fresh garlic.  Even the brownish \"sauce\" that accumulated underneath the \"balls\" didn't taste that great. My two companions thought they were ok, although I noticed they wouldn't eat them without dousing each piece in parmesan cheese.\n\nThat should have warned me, but we ordered pizzas anyway, and I was not happy.  We ordered a 6-meat pizza and the Giovanni's Favorite garlic pizza, minus the spinach but with extra garlic.  The meat pizza was all right- not great, but not good enough for me to come back.\n\nAs for the garlic pizza, I come from Ohio where Cap'n Tony's sells the best garlic pizza I've ever had, so I know good garlic pizza. Theirs was not only a bad example of a garlic pizza, it wasn't even good pizza- bland, tasteless, blah. You could see the extra garlic (it basically looked like it came from a jar of minced garlic, although that doesn't mean it was) but the pizza just wasn't flavorful.  I thought they might have forgotten to put seasoning on it but no, the waitresses assured us that this is the way it always is. The waitress tried to convince us that the pizza was just \"dry\" because there was no spinach on it, but we hadn't even complained that it was dry. We complained that it had no flavor.  \n\nMy friend gave the waitress a run for her money in an attempt to salvage the terrible garlic pizza, but the restaurant wouldn't replace it, and the waitress called my friend \"aggressive\" in the process.  She did add some ingredients to it to help with the taste but since we had a coupon and it was free, the restaurant wasn't inclined to help us out.  I'm not a confrontational person and I just wanted out of there - I actually felt bad for the waitress because it's hard to be in the middle of something like that, but I sure did hate that pizza. \n\nSo, this place may have its following, and the staff were actually friendly despite the disagreement, but I liked neither the decor nor the pizza, and I won't be back.

Anyway, when I go to Vegas I usually go to Firefly and/or Cafe Ba Ba Reeba and eat my own weight in meat and cheese...but not anymore. I have a new favorite Tapas place in Vegas and it is RE Tapas!\n\nThe restaurant is in a new-ish strip mall in the southeast part of town, that has a few other restaurants and a Fresh and Easy (another one of my favorites.) It is a well decorated, nice sized room with a large bar area where we saw several \"single male eaters having lunch.\" The service was great and the portions were huge. We tried the following dishes:\n\nGazpacho-Very fresh and light. You could really taste the cucumber and it wasn't too oniony...my complaint about many gazpachos.\n\nManchego cheese and serrano ham-Large wedges of cheese served on a stick with a large amount of ham wrapped around them and drizzled with a balsamic reduction. There were 4 skewers and they were heavenly.\n\nCaprese-small plum tomatoes that were sugar sweet marinated in delicious balsamic and fresh buffalo mozzarella...really fresh and delicious and served on a cool yin-yang plate.\n\nLamb chops-perfectly cooked and served with chimichuri and roasted red pepper sauces. Amazing!\n\nMarinated beef tenderloin skewers-very garlicy, moist and delicious.\n\nSmoking crispy duck breast-It was served in a chinese steamer, and it was still smoking when it arrived. They actually smoke it in the steamer. The duck was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside...it was coated in a dry rub that was really smokey and tasted like cumin. It was really decadent and fabulous.\n\nCoconut flan-The flan was served with a burnt sugar sauce and garnished with flaked coconut and an orange sugar dusted plantain chip. This is some of the best flan I have ever had.\n\nOverall the experience was amazing!

It's located right next to BJ's on 215 and Eastern, we went up and down the plaza expecting something small, but it's a decent size restaurant and sports bar. \n\nWe walked in and there wasn't anyone that was by the entrance so we looked pretty awkward standing around looking in to see what if there was anyone that was going to come out and greet us. Someone did maybe a minute after we walked in and we were seated nearby. \n\nThe decor was very nice and elegant, I really enjoyed the table setting and overall ambiance of the restaurant. The booth we were sitting at had direct line to the front doors, so every time someone opened the door it was pretty chilly. If you're prone to the cold like I am (at least during winter), ask to be moved!\n\nOnto the food. My friend got the Blue Water Meat Lover's platter and it looked good coming out and on the plate, but the taste was nothing notable. The meats were not marinated at all and the steak tasted over cooked. For $14, I expected more than just a few pieces of bland meat thrown on a plate. I got the crab cakes and chicken avocado cigars. The crab cakes came as a pair, there were only two for $9 and the sauce tasted like it was made from 1000 island dressing but the sauce wasn't that bad at all. The crab cake was a bit dry, they seemed to mix crab meat and a few other ingredients and then just lightly breaded before frying. I can tell you Crab Corner has much better crab cakes than these guys. The chicken avocado cigars($7), were egg rolls with some chicken, avocado,  tomato, and cheese. It also came with a sauce, the sauce was pretty good and had a nice kick to it. Trying the egg roll with and without the sauce I definitely have to say that with the sauce tastes a lot better. Out of the three dishes we ordered the egg rolls were the best seasoned. Nothing else tasted like there were any seasoning at all, if there was any. \n\nAs far as service, it took us way too long to get our food, no bread or something to munch on in the mean time, and took too long with our check. We spent most of the time waiting around. \n\nThey definitely could use a lot of improvements in service and food, I really feel bad for asking my friend to come out and try this place with me.

After we were unable to hear the cleaver and the knifes cutting up the meat in the back or no meat on a skillet or BBQ , He told us there is a new batch of beef coming up . We looked at the meat and was horrified. It was all packaged pre-seasoned meat. This meat wasn't even touched by this restaurant. came right out of a bag into the tray.  Probably from Cisco or Costco. Very shameful to call them selves a Mexican restaurant! even worse the two \"chefs\" in the kitchen were Latino and serving this stuff! what would their parents or grand parents think.

It pains me to say that since I like the Golden Gate a lot and have eaten at the Bay City Diner many times. I have been eating there almost every trip since I turned 21.

I ended up ordering the biscuits and gravy. My friend both got breakfast bowls. The food was very average. It was good and hit the spot, but it was nothing special. While dinner at the Bay City Diner might not be fine dining, it is  a good meal for a great price. The breakfast was more like an average meal for an average price. Actually, with all the cheap steak and eggs specials offered at other casinos, I'm not sure how great a deal it was. All three of us cleaned our plates. One minor complaint is that I wish they would use a nice big glass for your drinks instead of the small ones they use.

It was worse than a canned campbell's soup.  It was like they bought it bulk from the Cash and Carry/Smart and Final store and served it up.  And the bread bowls they served it in were cold and there was no incentive to eat the bread after attempting to finish the soup.  Anyone that yelped  liked the soup must never get to eat homemade, from scratch tomato soup and knows what it tastes like.\n\nI just can't believe how incredibly lazy the people that run this truck are and how they have the gall to call this actual food and serve it.

I had high hopes for this place after reading my brother's review, and hearing so many commendations for it.

Oh, sit down! We ended up both ordering the falafel plate, and we could see the owner promptly shaping and frying our plates. Soon, he brought out a plate of hummus and pita - when we mentioned that we didn't order it, he assured us in eating it. The wait was a bit on the European side: lengthy, but easily bearable with a few rounds of card games. Very adorable, may I add.\n\nA small dish of hummus with baba ganoush in the middle with warm pita? Now this man knows the way to my heart. Throw in a few olives, and I'm in love. The dips were addicting. Awaiting my friend's move in Goldfish, I'd find myself mindlessly snacking on more. Oh, but the falafel. After twenty minutes or so, five falafel disks atop a salad came out. Halfway through, my fix was quickly satisfied. Crisp, piping hot, and so flavorful. Egyptian style? I couldn't tell you. I was too enamored with them to notice.\n\nSo why the low rating? Two reasons in particular: the terrible feeling I had after the meal and a price discrepancy. I was still at the table when a surge of nausea and stomach pain hit me. I blamed it on the hummus, but after eating leftovers of my entree the next day, I immediately knew it was the falafel. When my friend gave her leftovers to her boyfriend, who has a stomach of steel, he couldn't bear the aftermath of the fried chickpea madness. Next, we were charged for the hummus and pita that we specifically mentioned we didn't order. I wasn't about to argue extensively over it considering our two falafel plates ($6 each) and the hummus/baba ganoush ($4) came out to $18 after tax. \n\nAn hour after leaving, I was truly upset.

Like another of my local favorites, Carlos' Kitchen, Paparazzi Grill is located inside a bar (O'Aces), and unless you happened to stumble in you probably wouldn't even know it was there, since there doesn't seem to be any signage on the outside.\n\nOriginally I stopped in to get something from O'Aces with my girlfriend, saw the specials on the board and decided to eat at Paparazzi Grill.  The space has clean, modern decor, nothing too fancy, with a few TVs on the walls tuned to sports.  The restaurant is separated from bar, so I didn't detect any smoke in the air, which non-smokers should appreciate.\n\nWe needed a few minutes to look over the menu, which for lunch/dinner seems about evenly divided between appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and entrees/small plates.  I'm a fairly picky eater, but just about every menu item looked to be something I wouldn't mind trying.  While we were deciding, the chef (chef-owner?) came over and said hello to us and asked us if was our first time.  That sort of personal attention to customers is something I really like.\n\nOn to the food.  I ordered the special that had drawn my attention to the restaurant in the first place - Chicken Pot Pie, which is something I order just about any time I see it on a menu.  It's something you can find on the menu a lot of places, but is rarely done very well.  It came in a small cast iron skillet, which I had never seen done before, and was very tasty - tasty enough that I ate the carrots which I normally intensely dislike.  Probably one of the best chicken pot pies I've every had, and light years beyond what you'll get at a chain restaurant like Marie Callenders (blech.)   My only criticism of the dish is that the dough/crust was sort of in the middle of the skillet (I'm assuming it had been filled prior to cooking) surrounded by the filling, which made it a little hard to eat the crust, since there was nothing it was holding on to other than itself.  I'm used to having the crust stretched over the bowl/platter where I can just stick my fork in and get pieces of it with the filling.\n\nMy girlfriend was interested in the Braised Short Ribs, but it comes with wild mushroom risotto and she doesn't like mushrooms at all, so she asked our server if she could get it without the mushrooms.  He said absolutely, and offered her the option of having couscous as well if she preferred.  She stuck with the plain risotto, and a few minutes later the chef came out and asked her if she would like to have some roasted tomato in her risotto, to which she happily agreed - another personal touch that makes this place stand out.  She loved the dish, and I tried the risotto which was very good.\n\nI went back for dinner a few nights later and had the Roasted Chicken and Mushroom Pasta, which if anything, was even better than the dishes we had before.  All the dishes are plated beautifully, but unfortunately my food looked so good on both occasions that I immediately started eating and didn't think about taking a picture until I was almost finished.  Darn, I guess I'll have to go back so I can get some more pictures.\n\nThis is a really great restaurant, and I hope more people will learn about it and give it a try.", "business_id": "CfYVBU9ANdjp4L5J2HV0LQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-08-23", "useful": 11, "cool": 4}, {"funny": 4, "user_id": "AMMRHG39KCixcpkO1kX0Hw", "review_id": "QSE89o0WBkNZ1R2ZTgoM-Q", "text": "When out with my husband for a nice dinner experience, we chose CasaBlanca because we had a wonderful experience in the past, being served by Tom.

I am not sure how long it took for all our food to get to the table, but it was a while. I did not mind because they were waiting on the rice to finish cooking and I am glad that we were not in a rush. The rice was worthy of being eaten alone. Plus the European style of eating is better for you. Food, similar to life, should be enjoyed at a slower pace. \n\nBetween the three of us; we ordered the gyro with fries (6.95), babaganoush (2.95), lamb plate (9.95), and a Turkish coffee (1.75). The gyros meat was juicy and a generous portion, but a little salty. The tangy tzatziki sauce helped mellow out the meat though. The accompanying fries were room temperature, but crispy. The babaganoush was perfection in its strong garlic flavor. It lacked a little kick, but otherwise it was delicious. It came with three large, warm pitas. The lamb plate was moist and tender. The large plate came with a Greek salad, tzatziki sauce, two dormas, and the heavenly rice. The dormas were not my favorite, because the rice was dry and tough. Due to how long we waited, the older gentleman gave us an extra basket of fries and made sure to check up on us frequently. Even though they are set up like a fast food joint, the man was attentive. The Turkish coffee was a great way to end the meal. The natural sweetness of the coffee was exquisite and the ever present taste of cardamom was a plus. The generous amount was more than enough to share between the three of us. \n\nFilfila will definitely be my go to place to eat Greek food at night. Although there were only two people running the restaurant and kitchen, their guest service was better than the other Greek restaurant I normally frequent for dinner. \n\nWith such wallet friendly prices, it is worth a try.

My fella and I arrived around 11am for an early lunch. \n\nThe bar and restaurant area were really empty, but we were greeted warmly and seated in a booth of our choice. The server was incredibly friendly and attentive. She, her son and her husband (who's the chef) were all really sweet and friendly. We ordered some iced teas and browsed through the menu. I noticed right away that there is a free specialty burger with Yelp check-in and the server assured me I could use it on my next visit since I was already using the Yelp deal I had purchased. That's great and pretty much the same discount, since most of the specialty burgers are $10 or $11. \n\nWe decided to try the Thai chili wings to start and I ordered the Mad Max burger while my fella chose the lobster mac n cheese. The chef came out to check on us while his wife was taking our orders. He told us about how he make his own hamburger buns and that what we ordered were some of the most popular items on the menu. They both came to check up on us often and I really appreciated the friendly atmosphere. \n\nOur wings came out quickly and they looked and smelled amazing. First bite and we were in love. Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of char and oh so moist. Even better, the seasoning was absolutely delicious. The Thai chili was just the right amount of sweet and spicy. This dish alone earned them 5 stars, but it got even better from there. We'll be back for these wings alone.\n\nOur main dishes came out and they were delicious as well. The burger was enormous and comes with a side of curly, regular or sweet potato fries or you can choose a house or caesar salad instead. I went with the curly fries, with the encouragement of my fella. I would probably try a salad next time since the burger is so much food to handle as it is. The Mad Max has a giant piece of short rib on top of a patty and lots of mushrooms to top it off. The homemade bun was excellent. It definitely added that extra something to make it taste that much better. Perfect texture, fluffy and moist but still grilled perfectly on the edges to give it a nice crunch. The lobster mac n cheese was fabulous as well.

More people trickled in after we ordered but it wasn't too crowded. My coworkers ordered the gyro lunch special. I set my sites on the lamb schwarma sandwich but at last minute I decided to try the soujouk sandwich with fries and diet soda.

I felt the portion size was a little slim for the price, but I definitely didn't feel cheated. The sandwich was tasty, but not the best I've ever had. I'll had to try them again to see if I like any of their other food better. I'd definitely skip the fries next time and opt for a salad or some rice instead.

I love I love I love this place. Great Japanese food, friendly service, and good prices. The best I've found in Las Vegas, actually. I'll be totally up front about the aesthetics, though -- the place could use some work. Dingy fluorescent lighting, faded plastic flowers on every table top, cheap flooring, and let's just say that thin little mat in each seat at the booths is there for looks more than anything. I find myself shifting from cheek to cheek throughout meal, to avoid numbness. All that aside, I am a repeat customer to Fuji. My friend and I dined there for the first time about a week ago. I enjoyed Combination A, which consists of miso soup or a fresh green salad tossed with ginger dressing (which they offer in a 16 oz take-home container for $4.95), two entrees, rice, and ice cream for dessert., all for $10.50. And it was worth every penny. Initially, I thought, \"Well, I'll order this, eat half, and save the rest for a nice lunch tomorrow.\" Nope. Didn't happen. There was nothing left to take home. Luckily, my friend shared the green tea ice cream, which was EXCELLENT, with me, or I would have popped.\n\nThe second time we ate at Fuji, which was this weekend, my friend's mom was in town, and we just had to share our new find with her. I ordered tea and miso soup for myself, and shared a rainbow roll ($14.50, but gigantic) and nabeyaki udon with the table. My friend ordered  two pieces of salmon nigiri for herself, priced at $1.30 each. Like I said, the prices are just right for me. And the food is really, really good. The menu is a little limited, but everything we've ordered from it has been fantastic.

Steak and eggs in the middle of the night were on that list! So when we finally tracked this place down on yelp after getting mixed directions from staff from various hotels, we walked our way over-some raced over in their still drunken haze-in the end we all made it. \n\nWe walked in with 11 people and the staff told us they didn't have any tables for that size, but found us our own little section so that we could utilize a booth and a table to sit together. \n\nAlmost the moment before we even sat down a waiter came by to see how many specials we wanted. A couple of our group weren't into that so we asked for a few menus and a moment to look at them-the waiter seemed confused, but complied and quickly brought over some water and menus. \n\nIn the end we all ordered the special anyway! haha. Not sure about you guys, but after a night of drinking and dancing I get really hungry, so yes, I ordered two specials! The specials were a 6oz beef steak, two eggs cooked to your choice and hashbrowns for 6.99. I ordered both steaks, medium and a set of eggs scrambled and a set over easy. The rest of the group got pretty much all medium rare and a mix between my choices of eggs. \nWithin about 10 minutes all our food came out together. I can still pictures everyone's facial expression that night. The moment the dishes were placed in front of us, I was able to learn what each person's \"What the eff\" face looked like. Like everyone else's steak, mine looked really charred and dry-the eggs and hash browns looked very appetizing next to the charred piece of beef though. I cut into my steaks and each came out slightly medium well rather than medium, but I was too hungry so I didn't care-the meat wasn't tender at all, but 6.99 for steak and breakfast, it wasn't a bad deal. My scrambled eggs were cooked really well ( not too hard to do right? lol) but my over easy still had a bit of clear egg white so I sucked it up and put lots of Tabasco to make sure I didn't get salmonella (haha the only acidic substance I could find and justify to eat). The hash browns were actually really well cooked-very crispy on the outside and tender and flavorful on the inside.\n\nAll in all, it definitely wasn't the best meal of our vacation, but it was personally a great deal for the price, plus we were able to check it off our list ;D! \n\nAlso, my friend to my left ordered medium rare and his piece of beef came out beyond well done so he mentioned it to the waiter who apologized and brought it back inside to be re-fired.

They were very accommodating with WONDERFUL SERVICE! I added one more star!----------------------\n-- I am very disappointed in the horrendous customer service I experienced by every employee I encountered during my visit. I called ahead and ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese. The woman on the phone  kept asking me if I wanted pepperoni on my pizza and I said no thank you. She asked me a couple times but I declined and when I arrived there to pick up my pizza I told her I was picking up an extra cheese cheese pizza for my Grandmother. She said, \"do you mean the pepperoni pizza?\" and I replied, no I did not order pepperoni on my pizza. This employee told me that I did order pepperoni. She then told me that I specifically told her I wanted pepperoni on the pizza. I have never experienced anything like this before- I just told her again that I didn't and I would like a cheese pizza with extra cheese. It was although she was fighting me and told me that I ordered something that I didn't remember ordering. My grandmother doesn't eat pepperoni, and she's 91, so I know that I did not mention anything about pepperoni.  She said something about her phone being unclear or something, walked away from me, and then I guess the manager at the time walked up to me. Again, she said to me, \"I hear you are picking up a pepperoni pizza\" and I told her there must be a mistake and I ordered cheese pizza with extra cheese for my grandmother!\" She also argued with me to tell me that I had ordered pepperoni. I was thinking - how bizarre- because I never spoke to her before and why wouldn't she just want to rectify the situation. At the time I entered the store there were literally between 7-10 people in the little waiting area and a couple people outside. I know they were very busy and I wasn't mad about the mistake-I was just upset the way I was treated. It's like the two employees were telling me that I was wrong. I just told the manager that I would like them to please make me a cheese pizza with extra cheese and I will wait. She said it will be 10 minutes and I said no problem. I was pretty upset because nobody had apologized and instead I felt HUMILIATED in front of a ton of people like I don't know how to order a pizza or that I don't know what I ordered. I asked her what they can do for my inconvenience and she said they would give me free crazy bread. I said thank you. I had to ask for her to do something! It was beyond bizarre. So about 8 or so minutes later one of the many customers in the store told me that he sees my pizza.I went over to him and asked him how he knows that that pizza sitting on a counter in the back was my pizza. He then told me that he heard another employee say \"this is the extra cheese pizza\".He said that it had been sitting there for a minute and that's why he wanted to tell me. I was confused and thought it was very weird, but I hollered into the back area (bc nobody was in front at the counter at the time- also weird because of the amount of people), and a nice new employee brought it to me promptly. I told her that I heard this might be my pizza and she confirmed it. Then I told her that I was given free crazy bread. She asked me for my receipt. I was never given a receipt with my corrected order and I did ask my original person that was working with me that I spoke on the phone- about whether I needed a receipt and she said no. Also the manager said no. So when the woman who brought my pizza asked another employee up front (one who didn't know my story and was new to the situation) she said I need a receipt. I told her I was told by two employees I didn't need one. Then she just walked away and the manager came back. I checked my pizza and it felt colder than usual. I told her that I don't have my receipt because you said I don't need it, but you were going to give me crazy bread for the inconveniences.She grabbed the bread. I told her that I wanted her to know that a gentleman waiting told me about my pizza and how it had been sitting out for a minute. I told her that it was less than 10 minutes and I am ok with this, but I think it's weird that after everything it would be sitting there.Then she proceeded to tell me that it was not true and it was impossible that it was sitting out because she made it. I told her the gentleman saw it and told me and I saw it and had to call someone in the back to bring it to me. She said well that is HIS opinion that it was sitting out there, but that is NOT what happened. I told her why would he make this up, there are a ton of people in here. I told her \"You know what, I wouldn't be upset at all if you guys made a mistake, I had to wait a bit longer, if you just said you were sorry!\"I told her NOBODY during this entire encounter said SORRY!

End. Of. Story.\n\nThey offer ten wings at a great price of around $7.00. The wings on the regular menu are listed under appetizer but TRUST me. This is a meal.\n\nThese chicken wings are are too die for. They are covered and bathed in this amazing batter of wheat flour (I finally asked because it is sooo freaking good) and fried to perfection.\n\nThey always come out piping hot, crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside. They are always seasoned perfectly and topped with sauteed onions and jalapenos. The smell of their awesomeness lures you in. You eat one and your tongue just starts slapping your mouth around because it is going crazy with flavors. (True story, this happened to me.)\n\nI normally like to dip my chicken wings in something, whether it is ranch, sambal or sriracha. But these my fellow yelpers, need nothing but to be savored as is. \n\nThey have other \"flavors\" but nothing compares to the salt and pepper that they offer.\n\nI am also a fan of their beef dried chow fun. It's always fresh and just good. I always order the stir fry broccoli for my son and they always cook it how he likes it. I just ask to have it slightly well done. They are always willing to accommodate and the server, he is the best when it comes to kids. He is always giving away some kind of toys from the vending machine. Another true story, I took my son's Asian card away from him because he wouldn't eat rice, but how somehow this man got my boy to eat rice. Me and my hunny's jaws hit the table because we could not believe it. That man has got the right touch when it comes to kids. So they are definitely family and kid friendly in this place which is a HUGE PLUS! \n\nI can't attest for many items on the menu because we come simply for the salt and pepper chicken wings and chow fun.

Those are my favorite. Although its not a pocket pie, I'd still have to say that their dates are my fave. It's a sweet taste thanks to the smoked almonds, and the blue cheese crumbles cancels out the sweet flavor so that its not too sweet. The nice bacon crunch also made it a good combination. I'll never have another stuffed date again unless it's with their sweet wine reduction, smoked almonds, blue cheese crumble, and wrapped in bacon.\n\nPanzarotti, its huge! it's very filling, and much like a pizza hotpocket just with that nice extra doughy crunch to it. If you're looking for a quick snack, this would be a good choice. It's like a mini calzone. They split it in half for you so you can go halvsies with a friend! \n\nTrailer fries are addicting! The herbs and Parmesan cheese make it go great with your Panzarotti. Thanks to the seasoning, the fries don't taste boring at all. \n\nSt. Louis Toasted Ravioli is like the pizza pocket pie, but just a mini version. if you get the ravioli, I'd suggest ordering a pocket pie that doesn't consist of marinara or any similar tasting to pizza or ravioli to widen your variety and taste buds.\n\nService was wonderful.

He apologized for not having what I was looking for, so I settled for some carne asada and pastor tacos.\n\nI hadn't noticed that there was a 3rd person in the back.  As I talked more and more to the counter guy about Juarez and the food and such, the guy from the back said that they had a bit of leftover barbacoa from the night before.

I decided that I'd take my original order plus an order of barbacoa.\n\nFor a simple to-go order of 8 tacos, the service was slow, but again, I appreciated the fact that they had the barbacoa that I was looking for so I'm letting this slide... for now.\n\nI got my food and brought it home.  They wrapped each taco in aluminum foil - a waste of foil if you ask me, as each square can easily hold 3 or 4 tacos of the same food type.  \n\nThe carne asada tacos were very good.  I've had better, even at the Roberto's by my place (although I am a regular at said Roberto's, so they already know what I want and how my order goes), but I can definitely order them again.\n\nThe pastor tacos were good.  Can't complain too much on these as I love pastor.  Flavor was there...  but they could've had a bit more meat in them.\n\nNow for the main event... tacos de barbacoa.  What can I say about this...\n\nHOLY TOLEDO... FINALLY, REAL BARBACOA IN LAS VEGAS!!!  (Is this to subtle???)\n\nThe barbacoa was DELICIOUS!!!\n\nA bit on the greasy side, but nothing you can't fix with a couple of napkins.\n\nI have to say that Burritos Juarez has found a new customer.  Prices could be a bit cheaper on the tacos since they use small size tortillas but charging Roberto's pricing (and Roberto's uses the larger corn tortillas)\n\nI can definitely recommend this place to anyone and you won't regret it...\n\n--\n\nThat being said as my review, I want to add something about this place for people talking about the \"Chicos\" tacos.\n\n\"Chicos Tacos\" is a restaurant in El Paso, Texas (and there also used to be one in Juarez by the Parque Borunda if I recall correctly, but that one closed down a while back... I think)\n\n\"Chicos Tacos\" is an acquired taste; people either love them or hate them.  The type/style is basically small flautas (or what people in the US call \"taquitos\") served in a small paper container similar to the ones used for nachos.  They are then drenched/soaked with a broth type soup/watery tomato liquid and topped off with american cheese.\n\nI personally prefer the regular, traditional Mexican flautas with cheese and Mexican style crema (not sour cream).", "business_id": "lLj9ULb01sNIYDbYbeUqhA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-02-01", "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "E3T0fbupNAFIrfeGH65iqA", "review_id": "P9a0DqwNygyvcT-mr66nlg", "text": "bun bo hue... yes it is pretty good here... kind of light on the spices but still delicious !", "business_id": "sBQA33hT0VGJHh0a5ERkPA", "stars": 4, "date": "2012-01-31", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "yXhO3w5BznYYTKD4B9UtjQ", "review_id": "YgMy96e9qadcfrDMRcADEw", "text": "Where do I start with CJs??? \n\nI was so excited to get some great BBQ that had such high reviews!

The staff stared at us blankly, without even saying hello. We asked if they had Mongolian grill, and they nodded. We told them we wanted that, and they just kind of kept staring at us while holding up a bowl. My wife asked, \"So do we tell you what we want in it?\" and finally the guy responded verbally, telling us yes.\n\nEvery other Mongolian grill I've been to, including all previous owners at this location, you get your bowl, you go down the line and put your ingredients in, and then you give it to them to cook it up. At this place, however, you tell them what ingredients you want and they put them in the bowl for you. This is incredibly annoying when the person making your bowl is barely communicative.\n\nNot being able to put the ingredients in yourself, you end up having to tell the guy whether to put a lot or a little of something in, and even when we'd do that, he'd just put the same amount. When asked to add a SMALL amount of chili sauce, he put on a full ladle of it. When asked to put on a LOT of onions, he put on the same amount of onions as he did all the other veggies.\n\nWe were also given no direction whatsoever as to when you pay. We stood there like idiots at the cash register, as previously you would pay before you made your food or sat down. After standing there for a few seconds with no one coming over to help us, we just seated ourselves.\n\nIt was actually difficult finding a table.  Many of the tables had dishes still sitting on them from previous people who had eaten, despite the fact that we were the only ones in there currently and there were staff just standing there doing nothing. Also, even the tables that had been cleared had lots of crumbs and debris on them. We had to seriously search before finding a table that actually was clean.\n\nWe sat down at the table with our food, were asked if we wanted something to drink. We asked for Diet Cokes. Despite there being a soda machine there, it was brought to us in cans. Apparently the soda machine is not functional.\n\nThe entire time we were there, no staff member ever came over to ask how we were doing.

We repeated, \"Can we have the check please?\" and he looked at us uncertainly. \"The check...?\"  \"Yes, the check!\" and he finally seemed to understand and brought it over to us.\n\nThere did not seem to be a language barrier issue or anything, as on the few times the guy spoke his English was perfectly fine. He just seemed completely uninterested in serving us.\n\nWe were charged the price for the lunch special, and it was only on the way out of the restaurant that we noticed a sign saying that the lunch special came with soup and an egg roll. We had never been offered either.\n\nThe place was just awful. The food was a little lackluster, but the main complaint was the staff. They were utterly non-communicative.

The patatas bravas always make a great side with a zesty sauce and green onions, and are a generous portion for the $5 price tag. The croquetas are not always available, so get them if you see them- they're as tasty as the version served in a shoe on the Strip, at a fraction of the price.\n\nTruly a menu with something for everyone. If you don't do pork products, there's the Pollo (chicken) bocata. There's a veggie roll that can be vegan-ized. Even pescatarians have the Gambas shrimp appetizer. And those are just the regular menu items! Each time I've found the BS truck, they have several featured special items, too. \n\nThough they may \"just\" be a food truck, the attention to detail and quality of product they put out is easily comparable to what is available at brick and mortar options.

Oh, if I could eat at Lulu's once a week I might die of happiness.

I had actually been stalking them for some time and really only showed up to try their food. The Italian Pork Grilled Cheese was simply to die for. Perfectly toasted bread, melty cheese, savory sliced pork, mmm. The aracini was very good, a bit on the vegetably side for me but tasty enough that I still ate them, which for me is a feat in itself (I do not like veggies.) I was amused that they called it \"Italian Fried Rice.\" Since I was on a roll with the fried things, I also had the Strawberry Shortcake Beignets. These will be yet another reason I continue to stalk Lulu's. Basically doughnuts covered in sugar and then again in macerated strawberries and whipped cream. I also bought a Nutella whoopie pie (which I had a bit later) and I have to say it was okay, I think I was not enthused by the nuts in the cake.\n\nSo for today, my boyfriend drove us all the way across town to Summerlin to grab some Lulu's in the Sugar's parking lot. Hats off to them for still working even in the rain and with their lights out in the truck. My boyfriend got the prime rib and egg sandwich, deep fried mac and cheese and I got the sourdough waffles with strawberry syrup and a red velvet whoopie pie. I have to say I like the red velvet whoopie pie loads more than the Nutella, and I am a Nutella freak. Going on, those very well might be the best waffles I have ever had. They were crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside and not sweet so as to go very well dipped into the strawberry syrup. The prime rib sandwich was good according to my bf but too many veggies for me.  However, we both had to agree that the deep fried mac and cheese was the winner for this trip.

My taste buds sang as I devoured my Pulp Fiction burger. You can taste that everything from the juicy flavorful patty to the perfectly toasted bun was handmade with care.

So maybe I'm biased because I was a fan of Grimaldis  but I went to Anthony's as a birthday event with a friend.  I was excited for it as I love the thin crispy crust of coal oven pizza. It is in Town Square which is ok but parking is a nightmare sometimes. The inside is nice and large. The wait staff is real nice.  They don't have fountain drinks? So you get a bottle at a time. That sucks. If I'm going to have to pay by the bottle then I'm going to drink beer. They only have a house salad or tomato and mozzarella, no ceasar. I'm a ceasar fan but I figured I'd enjoy the house if it's the only one it should be good right? Not really.  It was, maah ok at best and only ok because I got the Gorgonzola to top it with. The pizza toppings are about the same as Grimaldis as far as limitations but I don't mind as long as it's good. We got a meatball pizza, a white pizza, a tomato spinach pizza, and a pepperoni pizza. Yeah we tried a lot but it was a party.  The pizzas came out nice and hot but the crust is a bit more chewy and the mozz on the pizza didn't seem to be as fresh as I'd hoped for. So, I say if you're in Town square and want pizza (you must like thin crust) go to Anthonys over California Industrial Mass Produced Pizza Kitchen anytime but if you want great New York style coal fired thin crust check out Grimaldis.

It had tons of scampi sauce but it just didn't taste all that great.  Third, their free bread they serve you in the beginning is also just meh.  The only thing that somewhat redeemed the dinner was the canolli that came with my partners' dinner.  For some strange reason, I got one too.  It was a good palate cleanser and I wanted more but was so full.    And finally, there was a family there with children outnumbering the adults.  As they were preparing to leave, one of the kids just had that blood curdling squeal that lasted a bit too long.

Our team member ordered what she could based on what was available. However, we were disappointed to find that a number of dessert choices were outsourced from Freed's.\n\nOther than the service/flow issues, the food was great. Latkes were crisp and delicious. Pastrami and corned beef were juicy and tender. Bread was fresh. Matzoh ball soup was savory and deep. I'm hopeful that the kinks will be worked out and we'll have a reliable pastrami/deli option for lunch soon.", "business_id": "VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A", "stars": 2, "date": "2017-10-31", "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "EBOV52Ca_9VQTjl8UIqi-Q", "review_id": "rXg3RjDXmi4Wo8eUbvJhfQ", "text": "\"This place was a complete and utter disgrace the waiters were weirdos with appalling service our personal waiter looked like Frankenstein the food if you'd even call it that i wouldn't even feed a stray dog.

I was reading a review my cousin wrote on a Mexican restaurant and made me want to eat their food.  However, it was way too far from where I was at and didn't feel like driving all that way.  Luckily I found this location that was much closer.\n\nWe ordered two Fish (Tilapia) Tacos each, and shared Tortilla Chips with pico degallo and ordered guacamole.  How did my boss describe their fish tacos?  \"like California Fish Taco's\"  and supposedly by her standards, California makes the best fish tacos.  I did agree that the fish tacos were awesome.  The combination between the crunch of the fish and cabbage, to the soft tortilla married well.  They're huge and two was more than enough for each person.  \n\nAs for the Tortilla Chips, they were different and crunchier than most places I've had them from.  Their pico degallo were the best I've had and the guacamole, well that was just mushed avocado.  I'm used to having it with onions, a little tomato, and jalapeno.  But it was still good.\n\nTonight, I decided to eat there again and tried their Chico's Tacos.  This is a Taquito drenched in their red spicy sauce.  It wasn't too spicy.  It had enough kick to it.  If you wanted it hotter, they provide you with the hot sauce to add to it.  I didn't need it. It was perfect the way it was.\n\nI'm definitely coming back because I really want to try the corn concoction.  I think it's called Elcote.  I'm not sure.

It occupies the former location of the now closed Ay-Chung Noodle Restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has a nice contemporary Chinese decor, is brightly lit and clean.  The menu has a little split personality built in, but the pricing overall is pretty reasonable. Not to mention that their beverage menu is basically a boba tea and slush tea menu.\n\nI asked the head waiter (possible the owner or manager, since his Kung Fu shirt  looks distinctly different from the other waiters) for their specialties, and was recommended their Wonton Soup and items from the Clay Pot Rice section.  So I ended up ordering Wonton Noodle Soup and the Sparerib Clay Pot Rice.\n\nThe Wonton was pretty good. Meaty morsel with shrimp wrapped in a wonton wrapper that is as good as any other Chinese restaurant.  At $4.95 it is an inexpensive meal.\n\nThe Sparerib Clay Pot Rice was just okay.  Imagine an order of Steamed Sparerib with Black Bean Sauce from a dim sum cart and pour it over steamed rice and serve it in a clay pot and that is basically it.    As a whole it is not bad, it was tasty.  But traditionally the clay pot rice items are heated over the stove, so the rice closest to the clay pot will have a crispy texture, which this dish lacked.  Again not bad, but simply missed the mark on expectation based on the name of the dish.\n\nBeing a new restaurant there are always kinks that inevitably needed to work out, but I have a good feeling about this place. \n\nAmbiance: 4/5  Good lighting, pleasant Chinese decor.\n\nService:  3.5/5  Friendly, but not all the waitstaff have a solid command of English.\nFood:  3.5/5  Food was tasty, just needs work on the execution of some items.\n\nPrice:  4/5  Most items are not expensive on the menu, but pricing is mostly on par with other Chinese restaurant in this category.\n\nValue:  3.5/5  you get what you pay for.\n\nLocation:  West side, on Spring Mountain just west of Decatur.  Same plaza as the old S.F. Market, Swish and Shuseki.\n\nParking: 4/5  Usually not too bad, as there are covered garage with access on either end of the plaza, plus parking spaces on the second level.\n\nWill be a solid 4 stars with just some improvements and experience under their belts.

Everything I've tried has been great. The fries are always cooked just right and not too greasy, the green beans have a nice crisp to them and their fried calamari and clam strips are awesome. I wasn't a huge fan of the clam chowder as it's a bit \"watery\" to me but it still has good chunks of clam and great flavor.

Out of the five times I've been there over the past couple months, the fountain soda machine has always been out of order.

I left feeling satisfied but not impressed.  \n\nI decided to give it another try and had an amazing experience.  It started with the \"Tuna Sliders\".  A hunk of delightfully seasoned and moist  tuna, between two pieces of soft bread and topped with wasabi mayonnaise.  Delicious.   After I inhaled my sliders, I asked the waiter for a suggestion.  After hearing my favorites he suggested \"Banana Leaf Salmon\"...three words that would change my life.  Okay I'm being dramatic.  But when I took the first bite of that salmon I was shocked.  Layers and layers of flavor.  Tender flakes of salmon.  Painfully soft shitake mushrooms.  I'm starting to tear up just remembering it.  \n\nSo I'll admit it.  I'm in love with Dragonfly.

I mean when the women at the counter said 25 minutes, she meant 35+.  (Opening day, I can't take much issue with this.  However, I do feel as if no place should open until they are ready.) I think she may be one of the owners.  Nice lady, but you could see she was exhausted from the initial opening of the establishment.  \n\nIn any case, we ordered the Samosas, which they were out of.  Instead, we ordered the Onion Bhajis.  What we received were the Vegetable Pakoras.  They were really good.  Crispy and light, yet still dense and fulfilling.  The cilantro sauce was awesome.  Spicy and just tart enough.  \n\nFor our entrees, my husband ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala ($15) as he always does.  We think this was another mix up, because quite frankly it wasn't very creamy and it had way too many peppers and onions in it, which leads me to believe it was the Chicken Jalfrazi.  That would explain the extra spiciness that one usually does not find in Tikka Masala.  \n\nThey have you order by #.  Which I think is going to be kind of challenging given the goofs we have experienced thus far.  Again, first day...\n\nI ordered the Lamb Korma ($16).  Oh my goodness, it was wonderful.  The lamb was tender and falling apart.  The sauce was very flavorful and had just the right amount of heat so I could feel a bit of sweat building up on my chin.  Yummmy!  I loved mine, a lot.\n\nWe also had some Saffron Rice ($4).  It was tasty too.  Nothing special, it's rice after all.  \n\nThere prices are a bit more expensive than our usual India Palace, but the portions are substantially larger.  Allowing more than enough for leftovers.  Except for the rice, if two want leftovers the next day, order 2 sides of rice.  \n\nFinal verdict, I will definitely go back for some more and dine in this time as I need to make an update on the floor service.\n\nThe interior is lovely, but the lighting was a bit too bright when we were there.  Also, they should have had some fabric draped from the ceilings as it would have make a marked difference to the level of coziness and warmth.  \n\nP.S.  daily lunch buffet, if you're into that kind of thing...", "business_id": "mUk-0jToBuzk4KaDXp-uew", "stars": 3, "date": "2008-11-06", "useful": 2, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 2, "user_id": "0fG7akW_GqoA3iWMD8_wNg", "review_id": "aFkgY31qmucwXlZVFo9aUQ", "text": "Twice I have been to RE.  Twice I have been disappointed. \n\nThe first time I didn't think the food was too bad, but it wasn't anything special.  The service was fine.  The sangria was tasty, but way too light on the booze for my taste.\n\nThe second time my husband wanted to check it out as he missed the food from the tapas places that I worked at in NY.  We had the patatas bravas.  While the flavor was spot on, they weren't hot enough & you could tell that they were precooked & past their prime.  We also had some beets with ricotta salata.  Except that it wasn't so, it was regular fresh ricota.  Big difference.  I want what I order & if you don't have it please inform me.  I do know the difference.  Another menu \"mistruth\"  was when we ordered the fried piquillo pepper.  However, when it arrived they said be careful they are hot.  Piquillos are hardly hot ever, never, ever!  Anyway, they were freakin hot.  Maybe they were anaheims?  They got sent back & I love spicy food, but not when I don't order it.  We also had the chicken croquettes.  Dry, way too salty & I love salt.  They only tasted of oregano & salt.  Oh & did I forget the salt?  Dry, dry, dry.  Honestly, the best thing about the meal was the cheese plate.  It would be hard to mess that one up.  Even the bread that came with that sucked.  It was pre toasted & then brought to the table oiled, soggy & tough.  Oh & the serrano & manchego were fine.  \nAgain, how much can you mess that up?  All you have to do is plate it.\n\nNow the service.  Our server was not very polite nor was he at all attentive in any way, shape or form.  We went in at about 8:30 on a Thursday night.  We were one of maybe 4 tables in there.  He ended up having a large party of about 12 half way through our meal.  It took a while to get our drinks in the first place.  Which was funny as the bar was right next to us, but he was no where to be found.  I never got a refill.  My wine glass sat empty for over 15 minutes too.  He walked by many times too.  He acted as if he couldn't have cared less.  He could have made some money off of our table, but let that one slip away.  When we discovered how hot the \"piquillo's\" were we pushed them to the side.  He came to collect the plates and I had to tell him to take them off the bill as he had no clue.  I suppose it wasn't obvious that we didn't eat any of them...Finally he asked if we wanted some refills.  Where was I Denny's?  No, I want another glass of wine, but I wanted that over a quarter of an hour ago.  By that point the sheer disappointment of the food & lack of service set in & all I wanted to do was leave.  In fact I couldn't wait to get out of there.  That hardly ever happens to me...\n\nOh & the interior.  Don't even get me started on that.  The trying to hard mod interior & those dowdy curtains on the windows.

Hmmm. Sounds like the person that made this up has the palette of a toddler, and well.. \nIf I was to find a sexual encounter equal to my pizza experience at the saucy tomato, I would probably say it would be the encounter that is so bad it makes you switch sexual orientation. \n\nPizza came in a decent amount of time I suppose, I take the box to my kitchen and open the box to expose a flat sloppy pizza folded over on one side to fit in the box. Sauce was everywhere and I was just in awe. Chicago pizza..is not thin. It looked like the cook had made it from a Chef Boyarde pizza kit. So I called and the girl that answered told me that if I wanted the Chicago style pizza I have to specify that when I order or else it comes the way we received ours. Well actually she said, \"Ummm if you want it, like, the other way, you have to like, ask for it. It comes whatever way you got it then. Wait, did you want it flat and didn't get it or..like the..hold on....(long ass pause)...Hello? wait, wait..what did you order again?\" \nAfter explaining to her that I had ordered the Chicago style initially and received..something else entirely, she told me that the type of pizza I wanted would take longer, cool whatever! I am always nice and patient when it comes to my food and the people that handle it, I will wait for what I want no problem. They delivered it in about 15 minutes. The delivery guy demanded to see the pizza we did not want. He then told us there was nothing wrong with the pizza and 99% of them all look like that. He was wearing an apron and so I am sure he is the one that made it and does not like criticism. ( How you like me now asshole??) He said the fact that the pizza needed to be folded to fit in the box was like a bonus for us, and the sauce splattered all over the crust and pouring out the sides was also extra lucky for us. He was very aggressive and actually made us nervous this creeper knows where we live. He continued to yell at us about the pizza, us being two women with our very young childrenalso  at the door, also getting frightened. He then left and I was both relieved he was gone and pissed I over tipped him the first tie he was here. We took the pizza to the kitchen, opened the box, and the pizza was not even halfway cooked.The dough was almost fully raw and the cheese wasn't even slightly browned. I put it in the oven, really let the whole situation settle in and decided to NOT eat the pizza, take the $30 loss and eat a bowl of Fruit Loops. \nThe fact that order was messed up, that happens, it is not a big deal. The fact that the girl was totally unqualified to answer phones and take orders, whatever man she is probably 15 and its her first job so she is fine. But the fact that they sent a grown man twice my size to yell in threatening tone at me and my children is so way out of control I wouldn't believe it unless it happened to me. I wanted to call and complain to the store but my friend wouldn't let me as this fucking psycho knows were I live and if he couldn't take criticism for making a pizza badly imagine criticism about personal relations issues. \nThe whole situation gave me an epiphany about delivery. You never know who the fuck is coming to your house until it is too late. After this experience I will NEVER EVER AGAIN order delivery food to my home no matter how tired, hung over, late it may be, I will either drive my tired ass to the store, or once again go for a bowl of Fruit Loops.", "business_id": "7OkUKJNJkurXKeixq_ASVA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-01-30", "useful": 7, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "ftim8Jl7IOS53p0XxR3D_A", "review_id": "5KiTp0KvmFDA3oduNOXP9g", "text": "I stopped here on the way to school, wanting something different.

Always up for trying a new Chinese restaurant, being that I was in the area, JC Cuisine would be lunch. \n\nWhen I walked inside, I showed the woman at the register the Yelp Check-in offer for a complimentary drink. Going off subject for a sentence, I could create either a Yelp Talk thread or Yelp List on the greatest excuses that businesses give for incompliance with the Yelp Check-in offer. The excuse that the woman representing JC Cuisine gave is that the lunch special excludes the Check-in offer. I'm thinking this is not the end of the world. The bottomless fountain Pepsi is $1.55 or a can is $1. And most of all the Chinese lunch in special is one of the greatest deals around. \n\nJC Cuisine is a full-service Chinese restaurant that also offers take out. With that said, the woman at the cashier walked me to my table. She was friendly. That is a reason that I passed over a star deduction for Check-in offer incompliance. Wearing a friendly attitude she led me to a table in the back of the house that was away from the window. This was on a June afternoon during a heat advisory. From this point on she was my waitress and I was the sole dining patron. \n\nPerusing the lunch special menu, I observed that there is a $5.95 and $6.95 list. The later included shrimp based entrees. Proceeding this review, there is a picture of this very lunch menu. I decided on the pepper steak with onions. At $5.95, it included a bowl of egg drop soup followed by the entr\u00e9e with fried rice, and soft chow mein noodles. Complimenting the waitress filled the glass of bottomless Pepsi. \n\nNow, I will discuss the food. The egg drop soup tasted average. However, there was a tasty touch of corn in the soup. A few minutes later, the waitress delivered the meal. It was a unique presentation. This is the first time that I remember seeing Chinese food presented in a long dish that had three portions. One of the pictures that proceed this review shows the left portion holding fried rice, the center holding pepper steak with onions, and the right portion holding soft chow mein noodles. Working off the fried rice on the left portion, the taste was agreeable. Close by, it was more enjoyable working off the pepper steak with onions. Both of them were tasty and the right temperature. However, when I worked off the soft chow mein noodles on the right side, my taste buds were like, \"This is filler and they've tasted better.\" Immediately I asked the waitress for hot sauce. She pointed to the bottle on the next table. I grabbed it then blanketed the soft chow mein noodles with it. This failed to blanket my opinion of the soft chow mein noodles. They were not warm. Considering that the fried rice and entr\u00e9e were warm it was odd that the chow mein noodles weren't. Are they supposed to be not hot? Fortunately two out of the three items on the plate weren't bad. I agree with Meat Loaf's philosophy that two out of three ain't bad. Then again it ain't great. \n\n  The bill came out to $8.12 before the tip.

I'm not sure when those pictures were taken but they are definitely misleading.  This place packs SO much rice into a single roll, it's enough rice for almost 3 rolls and that is not an exageration.

The place was empty, so I should have taken a cue from that, but decided to give it a chance since it's right down the street from my new house. \n\nOne of the owners was behind the counter, the other was sitting at a table with his crap all over it. Judging by the discoloration of the tablecloth,  it looked like he has been sitting there in the same spot for the past 25 years to the point where he has become a permanent fixture in the restaurant. It also looks like the decor has remained the same for the past 25 years. But I digress. \n\nWe ordered cheese pizza by the slice. $2.50. That wouldn't be bad if it were a big ol' delicious slice of NY pizza.\n\nShe takes out these slices of pizza.... that looked TINY first off.... and old and cold. I asked \"Are those slices fresh?\" And she responds. \"Yes, I make my pizza fresh everyday.\" Um, I didn't ask if you made it within the past 24 hours, I asked if it was fresh out of the oven. I clarified, and asked \"Was it made recently?\" And she said \"According to health code, I have to make them in the morning and put them in the refrigerator right away. Then I heat them up to order.\" Where I come from, that's not fresh.... but okay. \n\nI order extra garlic and ask if that's fresh. She says yes, then pulls out a huge jug of minced garlic and uses her bare hands to grab the garlic and rubs it all over my pizza. Gross!  The food comes out and as expected, it looks like greasy, re-heated day old pizza. The taste was bland and unsatisfying. Completely subpar. I would have been happier ordering from a chain.\n\nAfter completing our meal, we leave and neither owner says goodbye or thank you for coming.... and we were the ONLY people in the restaurant.

I went in on Wednesday for lunch, came back on Thursday for dinner, and I'm still trying to figure out how I can go back again ASAP. The location is cute and clean, the service is engaging and informative, and the food is tasty and fresh!\n\nThey're marketed as a rotisserie, and their chicken plates are a highlight, but I have so far stuck to their sandwiches.  The porchetta is amazing, hearty and juicy with a nice crispy skin for contrast, piled on a hearty artisan roll with arugula, parsley gremolata, and a lemon sauce. It was a fantastic lunch, and I didn't eat for the rest of the day because I was so full.\n\nThe tri-tip sandwich was also tasty, with a heap of caramelized onions and a really great garlic sauce for kick. This paired well with their fries, and again, it was a humongous portion. They have seasonal soups; I preferred the beef over the chicken. Their warm and chewy pita chips are my favorite version I've come across; the $4 portion with creamy hummus is huge enough to be a meal in itself.\n\nBoth visits have treated me to lots of staff interaction, from answering my annoying questions about the food to trying samples of other dishes and getting detailed info about their menu and concept.

Tapas.  With our intimate group of six, we got a chance to try a variety of their tapas.\n\nStarting off with two pitchers of their sangria, we chose:\n\n* R.E. Sangria ($24): \"Spanish Rioja, citrus fruits and juices, and a few other special ingredients.\" - Pretty typical of your red sangria, lots of ice though.  Pretty light on the alcohol though.\n\n* Peach Raspberry Sangria ($24): \"White Rioja, peach nectar, sliced peaches, fresh raspberries, and peach schnapps.\" - A lighter fare of sangria, enjoyed by the girls in our party than the guys.  Again, light on the alcohol.\n\nTapas we chose: \n\n* Empanadas ($5): \"Stuffed with seasoned ground beef, avocado cr\u00e8me fraiche.\" - A favorite amongst the group.  It was only one empanada cut into two pieces, so that was a bit disappointing.  Pretty simple when you think about it.\n\n* R.E. Corn Dogs ($6): \"House made chorizo sausage, honey cilantro-corn meal battered, chipotle mustard.\" - The Big F really enjoyed these corn dogs, the spiciness from the sausage and the mustard gave it the necessary bite to make it stand out from you average corn dog.  Came with three dogs.\n\n* Shrimp and Scallop Ceviche ($7):  \"Lightly poached scallops and shrimp, marinated with citrus red onion, peppers, and cilantro.\" - Uneventful, although nicely presented.  We requested some sort of bread or chips, and all they could provide were what they called 'pita chips.'  In actuality, it was just plain pita bread. \n\n* Albondigas ($6): \"House made, parmesan and fresh herb meatballs, baked in tomato cream sauce.\" - Three meatballs in a nice sauce.\n\n* Baked Brie ($8): \"Diced Spanish Chorizo, green onions, and fresh herbs, wrapped in puff pastry and baked golden.\" - I don't remember any chorizo in the brie.  I was too focused on requesting bread or crackers to put my brie on.  They were able to provide garlic bread, but it took awhile for it to come out.  It also came with a side of leafy greens.\n\n* Colorado Lamb Chops ($12): \"Marinated and grilled, served with agria dulce.\" - Came with two chops and two dipping sauces.  I didn't get a chance to taste it though.\n\n* Blackened Salmon Tacos ($7): \"Confetti-cabbage slaw and chipotle aioli.\" - Three soft tacos with more cabbage slaw than salmon.\n\n* Feta Fries ($7): \"Smothered with crumbled feta and spinach cream sauce.\" - The one thing that our whole group could easily share without having to cut things up.  Tasty stuff because who doesn't like melted cheese on fries?\n\n* Rolled Eggplant ($8): \"Three cheeses and herbs wrapped in pan fried eggplant, baked in red sauce.\" - Looked like lasagna, not easy to share or consume.\n\n* Mini-Herb Roasted Chicken ($9): \"Herb infused olive oil and cracked pepper.\" - The worst of the dishes.  Half a chicken that looked blah on the plate and tasted even more blah if that's possible. Do not order.\n\n* Lobster Ravioli ($7): \"Maine lobster, tarragon, brown butter and lemon.\" - Three raviolis that held promise.  The one I got was cold, so the skin was hard.  However, the person who ate the one in the middle liked hers.\n\nMoving onto dessert, the Big F wanted to try their Grilled Apricots ($6), but they were out!  In the end, we had these two:\n\n* Three Ganache Chocolate Terrine ($5.50): \"Fresh berries, cherry crackle.\" - Very cute presentation with a mix of flavors.\n\n* Caramel Flan ($6): \"Desiccated coconut, citrus plantain chip.\" - Recommended by our waitress, good overall.  Plantain chip could be done a lot better.\n\nFood-wise, we were a bit disappointed by the serving size.  Perhaps we're used to being able to share our tapas with a group of people.  I would think there'd be at least 3-4 servings in each tapa, not two.  It would have helped if the waitress told us how many pieces were in each dish as well, so we would know how many orders to get to suit our party. \n\nService-wise, we were not too impressed either.  Sure, the waitress was great about getting the candles on the dessert and surprising the birthday boy.  But she never cleared the dishes fast enough or at all.  By the time dessert shows up, you'd think all empty plates and pitchers would be cleared.  Not here unfortunately.  And as a result, our table was always so cluttered.  It was hard to find space for our dishes as they arrived, especially with the bigger than average-size plates.\n\nOverall, R.E. Tapas was an okay experience.  They were some hits, but more misses.  It wasn't too busy when we went on Saturday night, which is nice change from Firefly on Paradise.  However, they are still in its infancy so they can only get better.

All we wanted was a Cuban Sandwich ($5) and a Iced Cuban Coffee ($1).  What the Husband liked about their sandwich was that they had two variations of pork in there - slow roasted pork leg and rosemary ham.\n\nThey also gave us a complimentary order of their Dirty Chips ($4) which was so awesomely good that it had us wanting more!  There's barbecued pulled pork, Mexican cheese, jalapeno hollandaise sauce and cilantro sitting on a bed of potato chips.  \n\nOf course, we couldn't say no to an order of their Key Lime Beignets ($4).  It's dusted with coconut sugar alongside a Tres Leches Caramel sauce and it's yum yum good!  And plenty enough to share!\n\nAs a result, we're always looking for where their truck is and the Husband got another chance to savor their Dirty Chips once again.\n\nMost recently, we found them last week and although Dirty Chips wasn't on their blackboard, it's on their printed menu (so be sure to ask)!  The Husband wanted his own order, so we got two.  I also got an order of their Roasted Chicken Mac N Cheese ($6).  It's definitely more chicken and cheese than mac, that's for sure!  The chicken was so super moist and juicy and it had to be a crime to be considered chicken!  That dark meat sure taste good!  It's dripping with cheese sauce, and there's also some mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes in there too.\n\nSadly, I haven't been able to order their beignets due to a restricted diet, but they had them with strawberries last week.  Also unique was their Homemade Corned Beef Hash Sandwich that I saw a few people chowing on.  \n\nOverall, the Husband won't bother with a food truck meet up if Lulu's and SnoW Ono aren't there.

Hands down. Good, GOOD stuff.\n\nIf you know good BBQ and, like us, you're stranded in a place (West Coast) where you're pretty sure most of the yanks around you have no clue what good BBQ is ... your refuge is Harry O's. \n\nLet's get down to it shall we? As a BBQ connoisseur who loves Tulsa BBQ over fake a#@ Kansas CIty bs. And who understands the Carolinan's get BBQ. And who knows that a good southern family who can cook some mean BBQ with a dry rub in their backyard beats any commercial hocus pocus out there ... As a BBQ aficionado I was so fricken shocked and happy to have found us some Harry O's. \n\nHarry O's is a needle in a haystack. A gem encrusted needle. \n\n++++ LOVE the service. They are nice and attentive people. It's a small family owned feeling kind of business which is a nice break from the vanity of Vegas.\n \n++++ LOVE their fried okra. \n++++ LOVE their collard greens.\n++++ LOVE their bacon baked beans. They really do get how to make good baked beans. Not a lot of places get that.\n++++ LOVE their dry rubbed ribs. They were just perfect. Nice and dry thin skin layer on the outside and moist, juicy, smoked flavored goodness on the inside. Anyone who knows good BBQ knows not to jack the flavor of the smoked meat up with thick overpowering sauces that give way to stomach indigestion later. Harry O's gets it.\n++++ LOVE the brisket. Like the ribs it wasn't saturated and slathered in BS sauce. It was moist and chewy and allowed to exude it's own mild flavor on it's own. \n++++ LOVE their dry rub. It's a demure and humble flavor. Nothing overpowering but most certainly complimenting to the smoked flavor. \n++++ LOVE their corn bread. It's like eating buttery clouds of magic. \n++++ LOVE the mac and cheese. It was a proper mix of fluffy cheese and pasta. The flavor was a melty / buttery / mild chedder. Hadn't had mac n' cheese in a decade and loved this stuff.\n\n+ Like their sweet tea. No complaints and they're generous with how much they serve you. \n+ Like their sauce. It's on the side so you can have as much or as little as you like. It wasn't an overpowering sauce at all. Had a nice orange flavor to it. Still though, the meat + dry rub is all you need to achieve BBQ bliss. \n\n= Neutral about that facade of the business. Actually I like it on foot and the interior because it's not pretentious and you ease into your seat and dig into your food without a care. The shopping center this Harry O's is in though looks like something you should drive right pass and not think about and that's what I am neutral too.\n\nAnd that's it. Harry O's is the first officially delicious, proper southern style BBQ place I've found living on the West Coast.

I might have to try again soon and update my review and then check to make sure that I hadn't offended someone there unintentionally.

I ordered the 3 cheese with bacon for $5. It came on standard white bread. The cheese inside was partly melted but not all the way. The Mac bites on the other hand $3 and 6 of them was excellent! It came with with Holla-Peno Ketchup and was well worth the $3. \n\nMuncheese is the sister truck to Slidin Thru and I know they start making some kickass grilled cheese after they start looking at the product better at the lab.\nMy only suggestion is using a thicker bread like a Brioche or Texas toast and unique cheeses like Brie, Maytag Bleu and Muenster. At least add thicker cheese and make sure it is gooey/stringy when pulled apart, I will keep visiting and I love the concept and will change the rating as I know you will get better,", "business_id": "75lNzRwmjHpuMwSaNxrMBw", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-04-28", "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 40, "user_id": "Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA", "review_id": "0HbKxDG2Fqtx_Del8JrdoQ", "text": "I've eaten several menu items from this truck.

They make everything to order and it can take time, but it's well worth it. \n\nJamon Iberico ($13) - This is some tasty ham! The split-top rolls that they grill in butter really hold the fillings in nicely and tastes great. While I like this sandwich, I actually recommend the quesadilla which is stuffed with iberico ham, mushrooms and mozzarella. \n\nPatatas Bravas ($7) - This is a full portion, but you can add a smaller version for $3 to any meal. The menu describes this as fried potato wedges with Barcelona style spicy sauce. I like the patatas bravas a lot, but the flavor hasn't been consistent each time. Sometimes the sauce it much spicier than other times and even has a different color. \n\nVaca Saltada ($11) - Braised beef, manchego cheese, red onion, spicy yellow chili mayo on a split-top roll grilled in butter and topped with pretty edible flowers. The beef has great flavor and all the fillings compliment each other well. This sandwich was well liked by all in my group that tried it. \n\nCroquetas ($7) - There's chicken inside these fried tasty gems. You get 4 of them in the order and side of Parmesan cheese bechamel for dipping.

Definitely not a place that you would stay and eat, no air conditioning and its very small. Meals are prepared to order which is nice, however it took a solid 20 min so I would call ahead next time. I ordered the combo which had 1 piece of fried cod, 5 shrimp, coleslaw and french fry's. Cole slaw was bland, needed salt and for the price they could have added another piece of fish, because they were small pieces. It was very greasy, however the fish and shrimp were great tasting. I also ordered a crab cake. It was OK very bland and so was the aioli sauce it came with. I don't recommend paying 6 dollars for a small crab cake unless it was great.

I had looked forward to Canter's coming to Summerlin. As it turned out, the place is infested with astronomical prices and infinestimal service. My brother was so disgusted by his $20 pastrami sandwich plus $3 for a side dish that he wrote his second Yelp review.\n\nI knew that Canter's was opening a second Las Vegas location on the Strip. In the front of my mind I knew that if a pastrami sandwich is close to $20 in Summerlin, it would be off the charts expensive on the Las Vegas Strip. When all is said and done, I wasn't chomping at the bit for this Canter's to open.\n\nThroughout this week we'd pass through the Linq between the Orleans shuttle stop and the Strip. Near the High Roller on an empty storefront door there was a small sign saying that Canter's is Coming Soon. I was surprised when I was walking in the Linq when my olfactory senses alerted me to Canter's. Only a few hours ago, it was an empty storefront. Canter's had just opened a couple of hours ago. Expecting price shock I asked if there was a take out menu. The friendly lady said they had been open about an hour and that I can take pictures of the menu. I did just that, then outside the Linq evaluated the choices. Astonishingly a pastrami sandwich on the Strip is a few dollars less than the exact one in Summerlin. And astonishingly, this deli does not offer the very popular deli staple: kosher. However, they do offer an egg salad sandwich, which is not too common in Las Vegas. So, I followed my olfactory senses back to the aroma of deli food. Disparite from the majority of the menu, the price for the egg salad sandwich is fair. The egg salad sandwich with the choice of bread (including a bagel) and two sides is $9.25 and a bottomless plastic cup of a Coke product is $3.\n\nThe same friendly employee that greeted me a few minutes previous nicely told me to seat myself. In this large room filled with Canter pictures and a new restaurant scent, I sat myself then waited and waited and waited. I'd even change my seat to the center of this uncrowded newly opened deli. Finally a server asked me what I wanted to drink. A Coke ($3).He'd place the drink on the table then the service disappeared. It seemed that I likewise disappeared. Servers just passed me by. Service was nonexistent. I'd see the staff standing at the entrance of the kitchen. I'd even see a manager seated at a table across from me that failed to acknowledge me. Then there was an employee sweeping that failed to acknowledge me. Nobody offered me a menu, although I assume that I was supposed to take one when I served myself. After approximately twenty minutes of being the invisible man, I preferred to be a visible man and exchange my hard earned money with a waitstaff that acknowledges me.\n\nOn its first day of opening, Canter's does not have a bug to fix. Just common sense! If somebody is seated for twenty minutes without a menu, there is a good chance that he might want somebody to acknowledge him and place a menu on the table so that he could order something. Possibly even a $17 pastrami sandwich. Canter's needs to offer more deli food that reflects on their original location. This includes Kashe. Finally Canter's needs to rethink their pricing strategy.\n\n....................\nReviewer's note: I gave 2 stars instead of 1 optimistic that the Management team will read this review and fix the issues discussed in this review. Las Vegas has a shortage of delis. If Canter's Management addresses these drawbacks it has the potential to provide a much needed good deli in the Las Vegas market.", "business_id": "VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A", "stars": 2, "date": "2017-10-20", "useful": 9, "cool": 7}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "g_zeVgyExnemji9VPX0dgg", "review_id": "hvvtCBZJW61ekroPEyaYOg", "text": "Ok, \n\nYou know how many times you see a random place to Eat, Drink, etc as you walk around...how many times do you stop? \n\nI found this little gem just grabbin a slurpee at 7-11 next door and decided to check it.

When we tried to flag down a server, he rudely snapped \"just wait a minute\" and walked away. Then he went to 3 different tables, checked on them, and brought them things.

The spinach was sauteed in (what seemed like) the equivalent of an entire tub of margarine.  I had to put a paper drink napkin under the spinach to try to soak up some of the margarine...a completely drenched napkin later, I sill had margarine spinach.  For the cost of the amount of margarine used they could have used a teaspoon of REAL butter.  The red potatoes I was expecting were home fries (breakfast potatoes).  My husband's Cajun chicken sandwich was as he described, they driest sandwich he'd ever eaten.  The potato salad that came with the sandwich was amazing, however.  For dessert, creme brulee, which the menu indicated as a restaurant favorite.  Hmm, it was more eggy than creme brulee should be, and was left unfinished--a rare occurrence in our history of encounters with this tasty dessert!  The service was also very slow and inconsistent.

Although he had never eaten there personally, he had heard it was an old-style LV steakhouse and a throwback to the Rat Pack and Mafia days.\n\nI had called ahead to make a reservation as suggested.  I was surprised upon arrival that the restaurant has no access for the disabled.  There are 3 steps up to the door and once inside there are 2 steps down.  I guess they are grandfathered under some old regulations.  They also had no secure spot for my scooter so I had to leave it on the floor of the casino near the poker pit.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant lived up to the old LV steakhouse decor.  Red velvet chairs and booths, dim lighting, white tablecloths with candles, waiters in tuxedos, and Sinatra music in the background.\n\nThe menu featured Steaks, chops, seafood, and the usual fare--and all a la carte.  Steaks averaged $40-$45 depending on the cut.\n\nNow to the meal.  I ordered coffee, and it was served hot and with half-and-half as ordered.  When I put the cream into my coffee, it curdled.  I asked the waiter for a new cup and fresh cream, and it was promptly delivered with a comment that they checked the carton, and the half-and-half still had 1 day to expiration.  One day or not, it curdled, and I could care less for the explanation.\n\nUpon looking at the menu, I had chosen the Crab Cakes appetizer ($17), and the large cut Prime Rib main course.  As I am on dialysis and can't eat potatoes, I asked if there could be a different accompaniment on the Crab Cakes (served over mashed potatoes), and a vegetable instead of potato with the Prime Rib.\n\nThe waiter responded that the Chef does noy allow substitutions.  Given my medical issue, I asked the waiter to check with the Chef who stood firm.  So I canceled the Crab Cakes and ordered a Caesar Salad instead.  I was by myself, and the tableside Caesar was for a minimum of 2 so I asked the waiter to separate the portions into 2--one for an appetizer and one to accompany my Prime Rib as a side.\n\nAs a single, I was put in a corner table in a little alcove which was so small that the waiter could not bring the cart over for a tableside salad so he mixed it about 25 feet away and brought it over---in one big bowl.  So much for splitting the portions.  I had to ask for anchovies as they were not offered.\n\nThe chef would also not substitute a vegetable for a potato with the Prime Rib so I went without.\n\nWhen the Prime Rib was delivered, it could have been a picture from a book on Prime Rib, and it was so tender that the knife just sailed right through it.  Then I tasted it.  It had absolutely NO flavor!  I was chewing on beef that was poorly seasoned and didn't even taste of beef.  After 3 bites, I called the waiter over and told him my problem.  He apologized and offered to bring something else.  I ordered the NY Strip, medium.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, the restaurant manager came over to tell me the Chef advises that there is nothing wrong with his Prime Rib, and they would be happy to cook a new steak, but my Prime Rib would remain on the check.  Alternatively, they could return my Prime Rib to me.\n\nI told the manager that I had come for dinner, I intended to eat, I wanted the NY Strip, and I had no intention whatsover of paying for the inedible Prime Rib no matter what the Chef thought.  \n\nSo I asked, \"How do we overcome this?\"  The manager offered to call the \"Operations Manager\" to override the Chef.  Ten minutes later he returned that the \"Operations Manager\" had  removed the Prime Rib from my bill.  The questions here are, Why didn't the manager make that call before he chose to upset a customer, and what kind of ego does this chef have?\n\nDuring the interchanges with the Manger, a table of 4 was seated next to me.  They had overheard the discussions and kept sending the waiter away when he came to take their orders.  After the Manger advised they were taking the Prime Rib off, they ordered.  The wife told me they had overheard, and if they didn't do the right thing, they would have left.  Good for them!\n\nWhen my NY Strip was delivered, it was puple raw in the middle and had to be sent back for a re-fire.  What I got back was an overcooked piece of rubber, but I ate it (and paid for it) to avoid further issues.\n\nWhen I want pancakes, I go to the Pancake House.  When I want waffles, I go to the Waffle House.  When I want a steak, I go to a Steakhouse.  If you can't cook a steak Medium in a Steakhouse, you need to get out of the business.\n\nOverall, the waiter, assistant waiter, and busboy service was good.  The restaurant and food was not, and that's why I would not go back or recommend this place. \n\nIf you really MUST eat here, be sure to stop by the Tix4Tonight booth at the entrance of the casino.  They sell dining discount coupons for $3.00.  At Bill's the coupon disount was 50% off an entree.", "business_id": "lpcniW0cBbQMSmksTrD_2Q", "stars": 2, "date": "2013-03-13", "useful": 0, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "KKyNPWd-3ckEWuNejEGldQ", "review_id": "dwltCcUpDCItjf-tK8We9w", "text": "This place is the bomb!

Well, I am ready today to write one about this restaurant. \n\nAfter having a heavy food marathon (buffet, fried chicken waffle and tons of drinks) for almost two days, I was craving for veggie focused healthy Asian Style cuisine in Vegas. \n\n9 on the Plate is a Korean Fusion cuisine. Your eyes and tongue will be constantly amazed there. I was surprised that all the menu had fusion taste with DELIGHTLY merged Korean touch. If you are not used to100% Korean traditional food-Pepper paste, soy bean paste, or/and un-ripen spicy kimchi, I recommend this restaurant for you to try them.\n\nWe were party of 9. Seriously, Everyone loved everything! We absolutely cleared all the plates and drinks. Let me tell you what we had:\n\n1. Lightly fried chicken with super thinly sliced green onion with light sesam flavored sauce;\n2. Beef brisket with spring salad with a very light soy bean paste;\n3. Pepper paste (Gochu-jang), garlic, onion marinated pork tacos;\n4. Panfried white rice cake with chily sauce;\n5. Bossam (steamed pork) with leaf veggies to wrap the meat;\n6. Grilled Salmon with kimchi butter rissoto (not spicy at all); and\n7. Cass (korean BEER) and Chumchurum (Korean SOJU).\n\nPrice satisfied everyone as well. After eating so well, we were so happy with the bill and we even tipped 25% of it. Come on, when you go to dinner buffet in Vegas (place like RIO and other hotels around it), you have to pay more than $30 per person. One buffet sounds good. However really, how many buffet would you have when you are in Vegas for only few days? Probably 2 times MAX? \n\nWell, this place, i do not mind eating here for my three meals for a day. So many selection and new fusion Korean stuff to try out. I usually do not like asian fusion because I felt fusion means just more blended food without any distinctive character. This one was truly different. \n\nMaybe you would thinkg the restaurant itselt, just looking at the building without looking at a menu will be a very expensive and fancy. Yes and No. Yes the restaurant looks fancy because the owner has a very good taste of interior sense.\n\nNo fancy and too pricy items because you will notice that immediately after checking out the menu. I bet a lot of people wanted to come in and eat however they did not; just  because they were fooled by the exterior and interior of the place without even checking the menu. It is true the restaurant was quiete however that does not mean once you enter there, you will be eating all by yourself. Do not worry, you can see some more brave explorers without interior/exterior bias are eating there too.\n\nIf you really want to check out the price, check out the menu from other people who had posted with their review. \nI hope all of you do not miss this place where you can expand your taste trip!", "business_id": "x9QvSK6njGK1q4NC9vq5mg", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-09-18", "useful": 2, "cool": 3}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA", "review_id": "2nAqLrGDaX39oY9tiaHRaw", "text": "Finding good pizza is a journey on its own. Thankfully you don't have to wait for the fall of Troy or defeat a cyclops to complete this odyssey. In fact all you have to do is go downtown and drive a few miles down on Fremont, and come to a nondescript blue and white building. You might question if you're in the right place, but trust your instincts because yes you are. Inside the pizza shop is very quaint. It has a very retro feel, in fact if I was told that nothing had been changed since 1994 I wouldn't be shocked. They even have a legit pac man/ donkey kong machine from the 80s. \nNow, most importantly is the food. The pizza is top notch. The crust is crispy, tasted hand tossed and well made. The sauce was ok, not bad but the cheese was oh so gooey and melty all inside my mouth. My test for a pizza is if it can hold its own without toppings and this passes with flying colors.

A recent  Yelp event gave us a taste, which was a good thing since we found ourselves in the neighborhood earlier this week.\n\nI remember they were offering Happy Hour from 4 pm to 7 pm, so we scooted our butts in for some Monday night football.\n\nHappy Hour means half all appetizers (except the Spicy Ahi) and $2 off drinks.\n\nAfter walking in and the bartender greeting us, we took a seat in the dining room in front of the large screen.  With a pretty decent selection of apps to choose from, we decided on four:\n\n* Potato Pancakes \"Ham, potato and chive pancakes with applesauce and your choice of horseradish or sour cream.\" ($7.99)  Four pancakes that are lightly fried and tasty.  We automatically got sour cream with ours, which was no biggie since we didn't even remember horseradish was an option.\n\n* Crab Cakes \"Crab cakes drizzled with our creamy mustard sauce and pineapple relish.\" ($10.95) - You actually get crab cakes, as in the plural, when you order this.  Three to be exact.  And the creamy sauce added to this dish very nicely.  You can tell there's definitely a decent amount of crab and not just filler in these cakes.\n\n* Chicken Wings \"Ten wings served with celery, carrots and your choice of ranch or bleu cheese dressing.  Available in BBQ, Honey Mustard, Teriyaki, or Buffalo style.\" (Boneless $11.95 / Traditional $10.95)  The Husband remembers seeing other yelpers order this from before, so he was game to get his own share.  I was surprised when the order of 11 wings showed  up.  He chose boneless and buffalo style.  They were meaty pieces of poultry and what a steal at half off! \n\n* Queso Cammarones \"Shrimp, artichoke hearts and sauteed spinach, melted together in a blend of provolone, romano and parmesan cheeses.  Served with tortilla chips.\" ($8.95) - Your basic artichoke and spinach dip, but taken to a new level with shrimp hidden underneath.  It's a heavy dish and you definitely need to share this one for sure! \n\nService - what can I say?  Our waitress was friendly, the owner said hello when he passed by, and someone from the kitchen came by to chat with us not once, but twice!  And the bartender thanked us for coming in when we left!  They are a friendly bunch here!  We even got little martini shakers as gifts during out visit! \n\nOther appetizers worth checking out would be their oysters on a half shell, bleu cheese tomatoes, and red pepper hummus! Next time!\n\nOverall, I'm always pleased when I find a restaurant with great happy hour specials and Straight Up definitely offers some good ones! \n\nThey also have different events for each day...better call ahead to double check if they are still going on though!\n\nMondays: Buy One Get One Specialty Martini 1/2 off 7 pm to close; karaoke at 10 pm with Karate Karaoke\n\nTuesdays: 2 for 1 Tacos, 2 for 1 Coronas, $4 Margaritas\n\nWednesdays: Live Jazz at 9 pm\n\nThursdays: 50% Off Specialty Martinis for Ladies from 7 pm to midnight\n\nFridays: Live Hawaiian and Reggae Bands at 11 pm\n\nSaturdays: Beauty Industry receive $3 off Specialty Martinis and 50% Appetizers\n\nSundays: Sunday Brunch at 10 am to 2 pm; Hospitality Industry receive 50% food and drinks all day; Wii Games from 6 pm to closing with a winner getting a free well drink!\n\nUpdate!  We returned the following week...\n\n* Roasted Red Pepper Hummus \"Served with crispy tortilla chips.\" ($6.95) - It's served with pita chips, not tortilla chips.  But that wasn't the problem, the hummus was really dried out.  Not sure if they make their own, but it was definitely lacking in olive oil.  I thought I had tried it before at an event, but I guess not.  Nonetheless, I brought home the leftovers and added some EVOO to help bring it back to life.  It still was lacking.\n\nWe also ordered the chicken wings again and attempted to order their \"Spicy Garlic\" style, which was something off the menu.  Unfortunately, the day we went, that chef working wasn't familiar with that style.  He did offer to make it for us, but we decided to stick with what was on the menu.  They also ran out of ranch dressing.  We were told they make it fresh, and the waitress was able to scrape up a little bit of what was left.  But by the time she asked if I needed more, the wings were done.

I was super hesitant with all the negative reviews, but still kept in open mind.\n\nIt's a large restaurant space with additional seating in the back around the corner with TVs abound  However, it's a pretty sterile environment, blame it on the high ceilings.\n\nWe started out with two pounds of Crawfish ($9.99/lb) with their House Special seasoning and Medium spice level.  (They have a warning that says their \"spicy level is two levels higher than normal\".)  The Husband did ask ahead of time if the crawfish was big and fresh, and the waitress said it was.  She also pointed out the tank in the back so we could have a look.  (I did walk over there to take a peek and noticed they had lobster and clams in the tanks too.)  You also get one side of corn and potato for order two pounds or more of crawfish.\n\nWhen our order arrived in a silver bowl, we noticed a difference right away.  This wasn't the way we wanted our crawfish, and that was our mistake.  The Husband asked for some lime, salt and pepper to make a dipping sauce, but that couldn't help this crawfish.  Sure, they were large, but they were also dried out.  There was no head juice to suck out at all.  When you break the head off, you can tell there's something wrong immediately.  And the sauce in the bottom of the bowl is this watered down concoction of something or other.  I don't think it's as fresh as they say it is, the ones in the tank are just for show I think!    \n\nThe staff were friendly, and really anxious to refill our beverages.  But it couldn't make up for the sad crawfish.  We left after our two pounds and headed up Spring Mountain for Hot N Juicy Crawfish instead.  \n\nWe didn't order the famous shrimp that gets all the ravings, but did see some on someone else's table, and they were large indeed.  But then again, this restaurant is called Cajun Crawfish, not Cajun Shrimp. \n\nI did ask if they had any grand opening specials (especially since other yelpers mentioned it), but we were told they weren't offering them anymore.  However, I did notice an ad offering a discount on beverages just the other day.   Oh well.\n\nOverall, Cajun Crawfish doesn't measure up for good crawfish the way I like it.

I've been here before when the restaurant was something else and it was just okay as I recall. Tonight was just a different, better, vibe and food was marvelous. I ordered 3 tapas: Tuna Sashimi, Jerk Shrimp-anadas, and Fabulous Boneless Mango BBQ Ribs. The only reason why I didn't give this review 5 stars was because I have yet to try a full meal but will definitely be back to do that next.\n\nTuna Sashimi had a nice seared flavor and wasn't overpowered by its accompaniments. Jerk Shrimp-anadas wasn't spiced high like you'd think a jerk spice might be, but was just right for most people I'd think. I like spicy foods so it could have been turned up a notch for me. The Boneless BBQ Ribs were caramelized with slightly crispy edges as I like my ribs to have, and moist inside. Nice idea, to not have to get messy and all hands-in with bones.

Now, at places like this, the shrimp is served with its head. Seeing the faces of my food has never been a sought after experience for me, but... eh...  Here's to new experiences.  Once de-headed, the shrimp was good, albeit just a hair over done.  Still yummy in its garlicky-spicy sauce.  The show-stealer, though, was the crab legs.  DELICIOUS.

I'll give them one more chance to address the issues, otherwise its time to search for a new place.\n\n@ Uni - First time getting to taste it. I got it when they were barely pulling it out the box. Nice creamy golden yellow color. Delicious. \n\n@ Amaeba - I like shrimp, but shrimp is just shrimp to me. The first time I got this they put a dot of hot sauce on it, not sure why. On the revisit, they swapped it out for fish eggs instead. A much better choice that doesn't overpower the flavors of the sweet shrimp.\n\n@ Shrimp heads - Originally they fried just the shrimp heads. The issue with this is the heads of the meat gets dried out if you're trying to crisp up the outside we're you can eat the shell and all.  On the revisit after my recommendation, they dipped it in shrimp tempura batter before frying it. Much better, and the meet wasn't dried out from the frying. Nothing left, including shrimp eyes! Be sure to request it this way if they're not going with this methodology from now on. \n\n@ Sashimi platter - The sashimi platter includes 2 cuts of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. Fish was fresh and good. \n\nThe above items are limit 1 per AYCE order and uni & amaeba is for dinner only. \n\n@ Unagi - The first 2 visits were excellent. The last revisit was disappointing. it was one of the few times I couldn't eat anymore of the eel. It just had the slimy and almost mushy texture. Why couldn't they grill it properly like the previous times.\n\n@ Baked Mussels - Again 2 visits were excellent, but the last revisit wasn't so good. It just wasn't baked fully through, so I didn't get the awesome baked taste of the mussels. \n\n@ Mackerel - The first revisit the mackerel came out a little too dry for my liking. The last revisit was much more juicy and had more flavors. Delicious. \n\n@ Shumai - This time they had pork. Again, they fry it so there isn't much left to the item. \n\n@ Fish Cutlet - They're fishsticks. Nothing special about them. It does remind me of the South Park joke:\n \n                      Jimmy: Do you like fishsticks?\n                      Cartman: Yeah.\n                      Jimmy: Do you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?\n                      Cartman: Yeah.\n                      Jimmy: What are you, a gay fish?\n\n@ Calamari Rings - These weren't so good. It was way too chewy, even for squid to eat.\n\n@ Cheesecake - It seems like the chef was experimenting with it. First time she made it it came out in a tart like shape. The cheese was way too hard. Second time it was actually a slice of cake. It had way too much crust on it, so you couldn't even taste the cheese.\n\n@ Mochi Ice Cream - This was good.\n\nConsistency of good food is one of the most important things to me. It doesn't matter if you can deliver great food once, but if you can deliver great food time after time.

The lady at the counter repeatedly emphasized that they used \"fresh chickens\" (I'm hoping she meant organic, since I'd hate to be served salmonella marinated chicken).  The chicken was relatively moist with a citrusy tang, although it reminded me more of store-bought italian dressing rather than a vibrant zest of fresh lemon or orange.

Yes even Hubby gets to the point  of no return on buffets, he wanted a real burger!  Hit the Groupon app on my phone just in case (if you dont groupon- you should!) and found Wildburger at the WildFire Lanes location on E Sunset.  $10 for $20 credit sounded good so off we went!\n\nOn the steps of Wildfire, I noticed the cigarette smell immediately, walking in confirmed it.  This isnt one of the mega-casinos with fancy filtration and circulation.  The Wildburger isnt too far from the doors but if smoke bothers you, be warned.  You order at the register on walking up, then seat yourself inside the restaurant space to eat.  I was concerned about how many people were in line ahead of us, but Ashley the cashier was quick, clear and cheerful to talk to.\n\nInside the tables were clean, well stocked, and the fresh brewed iced tea was great!  When it began to get low they immediately started another batch & it was out promptly.  When the server brought our food she asked if we needed anything and quickly filled the request.   The food was yummy!  Hubby's half pound Wildburger came out exactly as he likes, brioche bun, tillamook cheese & signature slaw making it tower over the plate.  At 7.99 including fries (also quite good) this is a very reasonably priced dinner.  My chicken breast was tasty & placed on a perfectly toasted sesame bun and I loved every bite!  The onion strings were good but the fries were better, just as Ashley told me when asked.\n\nSeeing deep fried twinkies on the menu ($4.99) I asked & was told yes, they still have REAL twinkies, and she described it as being between a Krispy creme donut and a funnel cake - SOLD!   It was delicious - dusted with powdered sugar, though I would have liked a drizzle of raspberry sauce or something to take it to the next level.\n\nOverall, not too smoky in the dining area, great burgers & sandwiches cooked to order, reasonable prices, good iced tea & a great dessert, and courteous & cheerful service = return visits!

The smells coming from the restaurant delighted the senses and we quickly went in to see what was in store.  The Mongoliam BBQ was quite delicious, as good as any I've had with super high quality (kosher remember) ingredients.  We also tried some of the middle eastern fair, also delicious, I loved the kibbah and their spicy dips rock.  During our stay in Vegas, we at here 3 times, each time was great and everything from the typical Jewish food to the Mongolian BBQ to the Persian delicacies were all spot on.  Definitely give this place a try and their delivery service was amazing as well.  They gave us chaffing dishes, a crock pot to use pre-Shabbas so our lunch was warm, just amazing food and amazing people.

But before you start slamming me for my two measly stars, allow me to break it down for you.\n\nFirst, the establishment is clean, comfortable, friendly, and rich with tasty old world nostalgia.  We had the same \"Turturro-esq\" waiter that E.C. G. had (lol!) who greeted us with a (somewhat) authentic east-side accent.  Service was prompt and not over-bearing at all.  One star.\n\nNow, it has always been my experience that whenever the word \"pie\" is used to describe a pizza, it was a dining pleasure.  This left me hopeful for a delectable dining experience here at Anthony's; my girl and I decided on sharing a meatball and ricotta pie.\n\nIt took a bit to get out to the table, which is normal for most custom cooked pies from any reputable establishment.  However, when it came out to us and I took a bite, it didn't quite send my tastebuds into orgasmic excitement as I anticipated.  I expected the meatballs to be hearty and savory with spicy abundance to offset and complement the otherwise drab ricotta.  It must have been on vacation or off the clock on this evening.\n\nA friend ordered this dish called \"Eggplant Marino\", which was supposedly named after Dan Marino's favorite dish.  Now THAT dish was good and pleased my 'buds wonderfully.  So I highly suggest ordering this for your eggplant lovers out there!  Here's the second star.\n\nOverall, I left the restaurant somewhat disappointed that pie's were their specialty.  My feeling is that if you claim something in your establishment's name, it better damn well deliver the goods.  Perhaps they should change the name to \"Anthony's Better Dish Is Eggplant Marino\".\n\nTwo stars is pushing it for me, but I'm in a nice mood today.

We're glad that we took the chance, and would definitely come again.\n\n12 of us rolled in around 9 p.m. (this place is open until  midnight on a Sunday night).  We were seated right away in the back area, near the Karaoke and the dart boards.  A fish tank was present, storing live crabs and crawfish.  The kiddies got a kick out of watching them swim about.\n\nWe ordered what we would normally order at HnJ--2 lbs crawfish each, medium or spicy, house special sauce. I changed it up a bit, getting a fresh dungeness crab. I was surprised and pleased to see that they grabbed a crab from the tank--nothing like fresh seafood.\n\nThe wait time was short, and the food piping hot.  The broth used to season/spice up the offerings was more souplike, rather than pasty like HnJ, and very flavorful.  Dipping the Cajun fries in the soup is a must, as is dipping the corn and potatoes into the broth. We asked for separate bowls of just broth, and ended up pouring most of it into the bag of leftovers that accompanied us home.\n\nComplaints:\n\nThe chicken wings and chicken tenders did NOT come with fries.\nThe darts are pretty beat up, and lost their fins midflight.\n\nPretty minor complaints, i know, but thought i'd throw it out there.\n\nWe initially went in with HnJ on our minds.

I thought it was going to be burgers in the shape of hotdogs, but sadly it wasn't (possible new menu item). They serve hamburgers and hotdogs. It was $3.85 for a singer patty burger without cheese. They have varieties up to four patties for the super hungry and don't charge for their toppings. The toppings are what you would most likely serve at a backyard barbeque spread: mayo, mustard, tomato, onion, lettuce, pickle, and grilled onions. We ordered two burgers with everything but mayo and a side of fries. The burgers are a good hearty size and I bonus points for grilling the bun. It did take a tad long in the drive-up but I feel that is expected since it looks like everything was made to order. The fries were crisp but a little over salted and I wish that they used that extra salt to season the burger but those are my only gripes.

I can say they need to take the Texas paraphernalia because this place is NOT TX BBQ. It's decent BBQ mind you, but it doesn't compare to anything I've eaten back home. Beef brisket was OK, creamed corn was gross. It was like corn sitting in corn water with tons of pepper. Nothing like creamed corn is in TX! Also the serving size is the saddest \"small\" for $1.99 I've ever seen in my life. My fiance (a creamed corn fan) declared it the worst cream corn ever made. I'd have to agree!\n\nThe issue with the meat is that instead of big slices of meat falling of the sandwich you get *diced* meat. You don't DICE meat at a BBQ restaurant as it's just a ploy to hide fatty gross pieces in your sandwich. A place with quality brisket actually wants you to see pretty slices and doesn't have anything to hide. The serving size on the sandwich was also very small - no wonder their prices are a litte lower. \n\nI was also disappointed to find out there were no combos with a sandwich and a potato.

They could make a killing!  We've waited so long!  So disappointed!\n\nI stopped by earlier in the day to review the menu since I was in the area, and happily found they had pani poori and chaat and other non-standard fare - pretty much the only nice, sit-down restaurant in all of Las Vegas that serves Pani Poori AFAIK.. but I digress.  \n\nWell I convinced my SO to go down there and give them a shot.  We get seated and order some chaat - which was OK but not as good as I remember it.   Fine.  We tried to order the Samosas too (like the first review) but they were still out... after 3 days?  Indian restaurant with no samosas?  Its like peanut butter and no jelly!   Turner and no Hooch! \n\nAhh... let's move on.  We also ordered a full dish of Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala curry.   The food comes out relatively fast - but we had the same problem as the first reviewer - the curry had no curry!  Normally the complaint is too much sauce, no meat.  This was all meat, onions and peppers, and a tiny bit of curry.  That would have been OK, but the meat was... tough?  \n\nTough, over cooked meat?  I can't even remember the last time I ever had overcooked chicken in a restaurant.  Maybe at some backyard BBQ when they forgot to check on it after 30 minutes, but not in a restaurant!  Not for a $15 dish!!  Dry, tough chicken, yuck.\n\nThe full dish of Tandoori Chicken for $15 is big.  SO BIG, it barely fits on the serving plate.  That's cool and all, but I'm making a mess just trying to get food off the plate.  Plus, the Tandoori is DRY TOO!  WTF!!  It's supposed to be succulent and appetizing and yummy.  Instead we're both depressed and barely touch either dish.  We get it to go for lunch tomorrow.  \n\nI wake up the next day and what do I find my SO doing?  Cooking lunch.  She wont even take this stuff to work.  She'd rather spend 2 hours cooking something than eat that meal.  *sigh*.  Such high hopes!\n\nSorry Taza.  Please, learn how to cook the chicken?

One positive: they have good pickles. First of all, the prices are waaaaay high for what you get and the quality. We pulled up to the drive thru (only 1 car parked outside, dining in) and no one in the drive thru. We were asked to \"hold on a sec\" - after about 3min my husband said \"hello?\" and we were asked to \"hold on a sec\" again...after 5 min we were asked if we were ready to order...ummm, yeah. We order and pulled ahead where the girl at the window stuck her hand out for the money, no hello, no nothin'. She gave us the change and said sorry for the wait, it will be a bit for your food. So we waited, and waited and watched a table of 4 inside wait and wait and then get their food. Then, we watched them eat. Ok...started to get annoying at this point, yes I could see them cooking the burgers on a grill so they are freshly cooked but come on! At last...22 min after pulling up to the menu board, we receive our food, where she once again says \"sorry for the wait\". We drive home (3min away). And unveil....well take a look at the photos I posted. Yikes! My husband's burger Camaro Cheeseburger (2 patties) $5.49 he got with ketchup, mayo, tomato, lettuce was alright, just alright but super sloppy! (You have the option to order mustard, ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion & grilled onion, all free). My burger, the Mustang cheese burger $3.99 (single patty) with ketchup, mayo, pickle, & tomato was bleck. Totally overcooked and black. I even got free black \"crunchies\" in wrapped up with my burger - see photo. Totally sloppy! We got a chili dog to share/try instead of fries, cause we thought maybe it will be good and wanted to know in case we come back (which won't be happening) since it was they same price to order plain ole' fries. It was slopped all over the paper, hardly any chili, little squirt of liquid cheese, and what there was of it was all over the paper, again see photo! It was alright, not good, alright. I cannot, I repeat, cannot believe it is $3.29 for this!!!! It is small, the same dog as weinerschnitzel for $.99 Cents!!! Total for our order: $13.80. Price it was worth: $7.50.\n I am sad, I really was hoping for something good here that we would go back to since it is close to us. Oh well.

After doing some pre-visit research, I had a an idea about what I wanted to order -- was taking my adventurous foodie coworker who isn't offended by the overordering thing - and is always willing to try everything I order.  \n\nAnd order we did, we tried the gyro, the falafal, the eggplant, the fool, the greek salad (because he hadn't made the tabbouleh yet), the dolmas, the fries, and Turkish coffee...  the check was under $25.  \n\nWadi, the owner, who used to work at the Bellagio - handled uniforms, from opening, and when sprung, leapt on the opportunity to live his dream -- so he spent his retirement, enlisted his daugher and her husband, and opened Filfila.   \n\nWe were charmed by Wadi's winning personality, his enthusiasm for the stove and his customers, and his food.  While his son in law is still trying to remember what each item costs, he's amicable enough.   His wife, Wadi's daughter was equally as earnest in her enthusiasm for her father's food and in the success of their newly opened restaurant.\n\nWe wish them well because...the food was terrific.  Standouts were the dishes that you can't find everywhere in town.  The fool -- a soup or side dish - made of favas or broad beans - is chock full of garlic, lemon, cumin and olive oil - with hummus, green onions and perfect tahini - it knocked our socks off.  His eggplant is brilliant.  Deep dark roasted and salted, it was a real treat.  His falafel were crisp tender, hot out of the fryer delicious.  \n\nMy only real complaint - and it's not really a complaint, just a personal preference, is that I'm not a huge fan of large chunks of raw onion -- I'd prefer them had he had a more delicate hand and soaked them in ice to tame them a bit, and his tomatoes were crappy - (but then it's January and all tomatoes are crappy)... but this isn't enough to keep me away, nor should it you.  \n\nI also loved that all his dishes had a large generous hunks of lemon. \nThe gyro was basic.  Nothing special - but there are so many delicious things to love about this family run new business, let the gyro go and eat like a fool...don't forget to order it, too.\n\nWhether you're Egyptian or not, I hope you'll be as charmed by Wadi and his food as we were.\n\nEnjoy!\n\np.s.

The dish consisted of pork belly, oysters, kim chee noodles, jalapenos, garlic, and cabbage. We were also given shrimp sauce and paste.

Our play was about to start so we said we'd come by in an hour and a half to see if he found it. When we returned, the waiter said he hadn't had a chance to bus the tables yet and we could check our table. Our table was exactly like we left it. Keep in mind this was 4 or 5 hours later.

The bbq pulled pork was just right because it wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce and did not hide the taste of the other ingredients. The Sassperilla was drenched in A1 sauce and by the time I ate it, the sandwich was soggy. The Chi-chi was my second choice, great concept but it was a little dry. \n\nWe also had a side of Mac bites and well I wasn't a big fan of the holla-peno ketchup.

My 6-year old decided to help me finish it before I had a choice.  Ropa Vieja and the Masas de Puerco were fabulous and filling, with the meats perfectly marinated and tender.  \n\nFor me, the only disappointment was the Tres Leches cake we had for dessert.  They don't make it onsite, and it had a little too 'mainstream' texture - a bit too blantantly moist, a bit too much icing, and not enough of that hidden 'cream' that surprises you with the real deal.  It just wasn't right (go to the Cuba Cafe for the perfect Tres Leches!).\n\nBut...other than the cake...this is my favorite of the 3 Cuban restaurants in town that I've tried.  If you want beautifully presented Cuban food, go to the Havana Grill.  If you want a quaint, but up-to-date chic atmosphere (and the best Tres leches cake), go to the Cuba Cafe.  But for the best overall Cuban home cooking, Varadero is the place...and make sure you come hungry and be careful NOT to over-order (not that leftovers won't taste great the next day!).", "business_id": "r7UZDbth0NtbZDJKq1-JyQ", "stars": 5, "date": "2010-02-24", "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 3, "user_id": "kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag", "review_id": "gBme0Ic8A1QE7c5hBIoziQ", "text": "I'm convinced I'm not using the search function correctly because I'm shocked this place isn't on Yelp yet!!!\n\nI love Town Square.. I really do. So many fun spots to have a drink or shop.. or catch a movie.. etc. I love Yardhouse and Blue Martini, but they get so freaking packed! When I go out I'm usually not looking for a \"scene\". I'm looking for more of a place to relax.. have a drink.. and enjoy the company of the people I'm with. If you're looking for something similar Bar Louie might be your spot!\n\nWe escaped the insane mobs at Blue Martini and stopped by Bar Louie to check out their free \"luigi\" (roast beef sandwich) promo. We barely made the 5-7 PM happy hour and were able to try some half price martinis and appetizers. \n\nThe downside of the happy hour is (and why I'm taking away a star!) that it doesn't include their awesome sounding \"specialty cocktails\". The promo was something like 1/2 off all wine, beer, appetizers, and \"martinis\". I wanted a mojito.. damnit.. Anyways, the martinis were good, but honestly the selection of 8 martinis here doesn't compare to Blue Martini. \n\nFood was good, but not amazing. We had the pretzels (YUM! But I'm a pretzel freak and really easy to please), loaded cheese fries (again they are freaking cheese fries.. how do you screw that up!), and the Luigi sandwiches. They were solid Roast Beef Sandwiches, but honestly I prefer the processed garbage at Arby's (ok, at least I'm honest!!). The french buns they were on were superb, so I'd like to try other sandwiches there in the future!\n\nAll in all a great spot to try if Yardhouse and Blue Martini are packed to the gills and you want to just get away and actually get a table somewhere instead of being packed in like sardines.

served with Rice and Salad\nMixed Fajitas with Beef, Shrimp and Chicken served with Guacamole, Pico de Gallo, Refried Beans and Rice\n\nRecently opened at 5795 West Tropicana Avenue, the former location of an Indian Restaurant that has been lightened up and rebranded with a Mexican Menu, it was with friends that dinner was enjoyed on Saturday at Chupy's Mexican Restaurant, the sizable space yet to catch on but likely only due to a lack of advertising as the flavors tend quite authentic with good prices for this style of Cuisine on the West Side.\n\nOwned by a husband and wife couple out of California, the Chef formerly splitting time between four locations on the West Coast before moving his family to Las Vegas, it was just past 7pm that the party of four sat down at a table near the bar where Agua Fresca's are currently made and kept alongside soda, a liquor license yet to arrive but reportedly on the way though apparently tied up by Sin City's lengthy wait list.\n\nRedecorated with backlit Mariachis, character painted walls and old photos of Mexico, the overhead music appropriate and not overly loud with a festive feel, it was shortly after seats were taken that both the restaurant Manager and Chef stopped by to offer their greetings, a laminated menu displaying several plates visually with several dozen choices including choices as traditional as Aguachile and Molcajete all the way to Nachos, Tacos and Fajitas.\n\nCarefully balancing authenticity with broad appeal, the fact that everything save for Desserts are made in house daily speaking of ownership not looking to cut corners in winning over a crowd, it was prior to orders being placed that a large basket of Housemade Tortilla Chips were presented warm alongside Salsa with a medium amount of heat, the quality of both impressive compared to most Off-Strip spots while a complimentary Quesadilla Appetizer was pretty standard stuff, though the toasty Flour Tortilla was quite fluffy despite being pan-seared around Cheese.\n\nNot dissuaded by the lack of Margaritas, though certainly many do come to a Mexican Restaurant with expectations of such, it was instead with Water and two Agua Frescas that the Meal was enjoyed, the uncarbonated Hibiscus Flower version mild like herbal Tea while the pale Tamarind drink was fruity and refreshing between bites including a starting duo of Shrimp and Scallops served in white-hot porcelain with Cheese, Peppers and Onions served alongside the equally sizzling Molcajete filled with a Tomato-based Sauce heavy with Chiles as well as Garlic below a rim ringed in Beef, Shimp, Chicken, Cactus and Cheese.\n\nServing well-seasoned Mexican Rice and scratch-made Refried Beans with most plates, the latter showing a lot of care in terms of texture and flavor with great smoothness and just a touch of Cumin and Salt, it was with the first two plates still being enjoyed that a jumbo Burrito stuffed with Chorizo and all the traditional fixings was served next to Aguachiles so spicy and clean that one may assume that they have crossed the border, the Chef even going so far as to leave the tails on as they do in Mexico City which, although authentic, may come as a surprise to less experienced or unsuspecting diners.\n\nRounding things out with a Mixed Fajita platter, the choice of housemade Corn or Flour Tortillas a nice touch with everything on the sizzling plate meeting the same high standard as those before it, it was after hearing that Desserts were thus far outsourced that the decision was made to end the meal with a bit more of the Burrito, the smoky Red Sauce having at this point penetrated deeply with both the Rice and Meat inside well saturated and all the better for it. \n\n***1/2: Just starting to get up to speed, the failure to secure a liquor license prior to opening and virtually no social media presence to speak of seemingly rookie mistakes for someone with previous Restaurant experience, Chupy's shows a lot of promise for those seeking both Authentic and \"Americanized\" Mexican Food from a kitchen and ownership that so far seems committed to doing things right.", "business_id":

This is now my favorite casual med place in town.\n\nWe ordered the fool plate, hummus, baba, the cucumber yoghurt, tabbouleh and spinach pies.  This is a family run place and everything is made to order.  Other reviewers have noted that this is not a quick-stop place.  Whether they realize it or not, they're doing slow food here and it shows in the quality and the taste.\n\nFor example, my husband is not generally a huge tabbouleh fan, but he was fighting me for forkfuls of Filfila's because it was so fresh that you really taste the herbs and lemon juice and the tomatos aren't all mushy.  It's miles away from the pre-made salad bar stuff.\n\nThe fool is an unusual dish for Vegas med-style restaurants.  It's a stewed fava bean dish which is served with olive oil and tahina sauce.  The beans were cooked perfectly - soft enough to be edible but not soft enough to loose texture.  The tahina served with it is very fresh and made with a good balance of lemon and garlic.\n\nDecor-wise this is pretty much your standard strip-mall ethnic restaurant, but the food more than makes up for the lack of ambiance.\n\nService is friendly but a little scattered.

Not 100% authentic, All good, just enjoy your food outdoors while you people watch.  You'll feel transported.\n\nCredit where credit is due: thanks Stefany V for the recommendation.\n\nBocadillos, traditional Barcelona sandwiches, feature OUTSTANDING fresh bread with flavor, slightly chewy, toasted crisp that manages to hold everything in perfectly.  Amped up mayo and spreads and fresh veg and micro greens that actually make sense (the flavor of the micro greens adds to the enjoyment of the sandwich).  Proteins, very well chosen and blend well with everything.  The Jamon Serrano, sweet porky goodness and cured funk that pairs well with the mushrooms.  The Botifarra; naturally cased, coarse ground seasoned pork; delicious and fatty, intensified by a great chimichurri mojo verde.  Finally the vaca saltada; braised beef with manchego cheese and an earthy chili mayo, just plain good eats.\n\nDo try an order of patas bravas (deep fried thick potato wedges with a spicy aioli).  Fluffy on the inside, gently crisp on the outside, it makes a perfect, rich side to any sandwich.\n\nNote: If you have not tried Iberico ham from black footed, acorn fed pigs, AND it's on offer here, go for it.  It might not be as good as that sold by places on the Strip but at 1/3 the price, unless you're a true gourmand, your tongue won't know the difference.\n\nPrices are in line with the quality.  No foot long subs for $5 here.\n\nIf they only sold wine by the glass and that other famous Barcelona street food, churros.

All the rolls kind of scared me because I was wondering what the quality of their fish really was due to so many rolls and not so much sushi. \n\nOrdered sushi of Spanish mackerel and it was very tasty so I thought lets try the sushi. I ordered the Chirashi which is a traditional bowl of sashimi. It was AWESOME!!! I had three pieces of tuna, salmon, octopus, squid. Two pieces of Delicious halibut, Spanish mackerel, shrimp, crab and the kicker yellow tail belly. Topped off with a Japanese mushroom, rice, seaweed and salmon eggs. It was soo good. If you order the Cherish you have to be willing to eat what you get. This bowl is for a true sushi lover. Also it is an awesome deal at only $19.95. Tip: let the sushi chefs make it their way.

My friend Sharr and I ordered different items so we can sample more dishes. We ordered the Beef Biriyani, Tandoori Chicken sizzler, and the Garlic Naan. The Beef Biriyani was good on the inside where all the beef and spices were but on the outside it was like white rice. I'm used to having the spices spread throughout . I would have to say I like Bollywood's Briyani better because of how the spices are spread through out  the whole dish and they have a curry sauce that they serve on the side with it. I was impressed with the Tandoori Chicken sizzler ...anything that sizzles on a plate gets me instantly excited. I've never had Tandoori before so I have nothing to compare it to but I thought it was tasty! The Garlic Naan here is flavorful and I like how they pre cut it before it's served.

Well, I don't really live on that side of town so I kind of forgot about it until recently this past weekend when I happened to be next door to it. Well, I was told by the person at the front that they are under new ownership and I have to say, food wise this place has changed.

Let's start with the sides first: The greens - still delicious, with a hint of bacon in them, the M &C - not bad, pretty good no real complaints, the beef brisket - tender, but wayyyy more fatty than I last remember and a little saltier too but still not bad. \n\nHowever, the ribs I'm sorry but I have to give them a solid D-. They were rubbery, barely seasoned, chewy and gristly, and no amount of their delicious barbecue sauce could compensate for their overall lack of quality. I couldn't even get the dog to eat the leftover ribs, and that's saying something since he would probably eat a rock covered with barbecue sauce if his teeth were strong enough. I don't know if this is due to new ownership and changed meat quality or if maybe my taste buds have changed since I was last there but this is not how ribs are supposed to be.

The space was previously occupied by an Indian restaurant that for better or worse, didn't last long. Previous to that was another ethnic restaurant that suffered the same fate. That's the reason why I bring it up: it's a really nice space that actually looks as if it has much more potential than just a hole-in-the-wall place to grab a lunch. I hope the owners continue improving the overall look of the place, as I want this place to stick around a while, especially since it's proven to be a space with a bit of a jinx. \n\nThe food is where things turn everything else on it's head. The chips and salsa are both freshly made, and you can tell. Next, they actually bring you a small bowl of soup (akin to vegetable beef I'd say.) I'll get back to that soup later. \n\nThe main courses I've had have all been really good. There are bright flavors to be had in nearly every bite. The carnitas are pure porky paradise, and aren't the dry mouthful of sand that are often served elsewhere; sad, unfortunate victims of sitting too long. *sniffle* What a waste! Luckily, Chupy's respects the ingredients they use, and serve them up right. The flavor adventure is quite obviously guided by an authentic, experienced hand -- it tastes as if you were invited over to someone's home for a meal. It's then that you forgive the surroundings, because you know you've found something true; something special. In some ways, you almost want it to be your own little secret. Unfortunately, the history of the space won't allow that. \n\nThe first time at Chupy's, a night shortly after they opened, was funny. It took around ten minutes to be noticed for seating, despite there only being one other party in the entire dining room. The previously mentioned soup had stars for noodles. There was a bar with no alcohol. Now, the soup is served as if it's actually meant for adults. Service is quick, and personable. They serve alcohol. The food remains as good as always.

The cost, however, for many of the dishes is half of what you might pay at a similar restaurant on the strip.  All-you-can-eat pasta in many different styles is $7.99.  While it doesn't show this on the menu, it is advertised throughout the casino.  Add to this the dark, romantic atmosphere and the appropriate music and you may have a nice date here (except for when someone like me brings his little kid who makes a lot of noise).\n\nThe quality of the food is quite good though it is just common Italian restaurant faire.  I always enjoy my meal and it's accessories (soup, salad, bread).  Do not fill up on the bread, of course, as all-you-can-eat ends up being one plate (the portions are quite large for one plate).\n\nLastly, the dessert was a surprise (though again, for an Italian restaurant, not so surprising).  Usually I will take my son to the bakery in Palace Station and let him pick something out.  However this time the waitress asked if we would like dessert and I asked what they had.  She mentioned Gelato (an Italian ice-cream type dessert).  When I asked her how much, she stated it was $1.99 for each (flavors like Cappucino, Pistachio and Vanilla Bean to name a few).  I expected a small, small portion but again the portion was large and we were thoroughly satisified with what we had ordered.\n\nIn summary, Pasta Palace at Palace Station is an excellent choice for an Italian dinner (hours are from 5pm to around Midnight).  On Mondays the dinner is $19.99 per person as local crooner Wes Winters performs a classic Vegas-style dinner and a show (I have not been to this but it sounds like a nice time).\n\nSince I am the first to review this, I hope others check it out and add their input.", "business_id": "QfD_KzfBGRZ1OLu1Vs1rrA", "stars": 4, "date": "2008-01-25", "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "bBpJzsvN6Fl62oTfSnLBcQ", "review_id": "_azRI8kC5Y6T247kDrw5VA", "text": "Cool atmosphere.

Roll it inside a pork belly, it's skin on the outside.  Season heavily.  Rotisserie roast until golden brown, cracklin on the outside,  juicy, and fatty in all the right ways on the inside.  Slice that bad boy up.  Shove it in a fresh baked, chewy, crispy baguette, wilt up some greens, add a generous slathering of herbaceous, lemony, garlicky gremolata.  Heaven.  The crispy pork cracklin adds great texture while the sweetness of the pork is brought out by the bright gremolata.  An outstanding sandwich.  A solid value at $12.\n\nAlso available, a rotisserie chicken and tri-tip.  Ordered as a plate, the chicken is as good as any.  The tri-tip, well seasoned, cooked medium, tender, juicy, it's flavor brought to life by the spice heat of an aji verde (Peruvian green chili sauce).

We let him know, right away, we had little time to eat(about 30 mins) and we were ready to dive into some food. They offer \"1 Free Specialty Burger\" when you \"check in\" on Yelp. They had no problem redeeming the ad and they also let my wife and I know our son eats for free with any entree purchased. We were like, \"Whaaaaatt...?? Wow!\" How awesome right? \n\nOur son got the kids \"Grilled Cheese\"(refer to pic) which was actually great.  For a kids grilled cheese, this thing was fantastic. It had 3 kinds of cheese, with perfectly toasted bread. You can't go wrong.\n\nAt first, I ordered the \"Mad Maxx\" burger and was super excited to get it. After a few minutes, Cameron came out with the bad news that there were no more short ribs for the \"Mad Maxx\" burger. Disappointing..., but I already had a plan B burger, the \"Tombstone Burger\" (refer to pic) which he said was available. This burger..... was.....Incredible! The thing was HUGE! Big, crispy pieces of bacon, house made burbon glaze, beautifully battered onion rings, a bun made for the gods, and a burger patty that was ooozing perfection. To top it all off, sticking 6 inches out the top of the burger, was a wooden handled steak knife which needed no explanation for its use. The burger was a BEAST and I couldn't have asked for anything more, other than a third hand to help shove it faster into my mouth. Superb!\n\nMy wife ordered the \"Heart Attack Burger\" which she couldn't put down. Shoe string potatoes, cheddar cheese, and peppered bacon, all on top of a perfectly cooked patty. Delicious to the last bite.\n\nChef Jay came out after our meal to check on us and make sure we had a great experience. What a great guy/chef.

Very filling.\n\n1 side order of mexi-fries: fries with chili, lime, and parmesan flavor, covered in sweet corn relish; decent flavor, but a little too sweet/tart for my liking.\n\nThe pastry pockets themselves were hot, crispy, flaky, and chewy. I ordered too much food, because I wanted to try a few different flavors, and each pocket is quite large - think a bit smaller than a large calzone.

We travel to the East side of Las Vegas and boy did I have a hankering for something special, home style and humble. I remember a long time as a young teenager that after going to Broadacres swap meet we ended up finding a Tejuino vendor and if you don't know what this is, it's a flavorful punch in the mouth of a drink from Jalisco, Mexico. \n\nAfter falling in love with this drink for it's flavorful and tangy taste, I quickly  realized that \"Tejuino\" was not widely available among traditional Mexican restaurants that Toni and I visited. I was on a mission, something special maybe a sit down place, maybe something that could satisfy. I had to find it. \n\nWhen searching, even google had a hard time searching for anything besides odd street vendor listings, which is amazing because back in the day, street vendors didn't even know what GPS was let along reviews. But good on em' for at least being listed but this wasn't what I was looking. \n\nAfter calling my father to see if he remembered a restaurant or sit down spot, he quickly directed me to \"La Reyna\". I was skeptical because not only did he know of a restaurant that specializes in Jalisco style Tejuino, he beet out Google and even gave me an address. So Toni and I were in a mission, and into my Ford Focus we went.\n\nNow, I need anyone reading this to look past the location because I was not familiar with it and when I found it, it was not in a spot that I felt gave this place any credit. You will find a Market, some small style shops and La Reina last from the L-shape shopping lineup. But it was a diamond in the rough...\n\nWalking in, it was a completely different atmosphere. Walls were lined with authentic Mexican film memorabilia and classic Mexican posters. The tables were somewhat clean on the top but had some sticky touch on the crease of the walls and some on the drink specials. Toni also picked up a small smudge on her finger from under the table and we didn't know what it was, napkins at the table would have been a good idea specifically for this. The soccer game that day was playing on the TV loud enough to hear the announcers but low enough to enjoy a conversation from any seating place in the building. \n\nAs always, I had to take a look at the restrooms just to see if this was all a mirage but clean in the men's, will have to assume for the women's bathroom, sorry. We sat on the booth seats together facing the TV and was quickly greeted by an older lady that reminded me of my own family and was quickly transported to my grandmother's house. \n\nI quickly asked if they served Tejuino and she said that majical word, \"Si, Como no?\". Toni not understanding the magic, she quickly ordered a Coke, she didn't know what we were into. Once we received the menu, most had names and pictures which is my favorite type. Everything looked delicious and a combination of what I would get at my mother's/grandmother's house celebrating a family get together. \n\nToni chose her tried and true Chicken Fajitas and I ventured into unknown territory with the \"Mar I Tiera\" plate. Toni's chicken fajitas had a traditional plate of shredded lettus with dressing, authentic beans with crumbled \"queso fresco\" on top and some rice along with the delicious rotisery chicken and veggie slices. At one point, a fly was buzzing around and due to randomness, it fell into Toni's coke. The older lady quickly brought a replacement coke but I thought they could use an industrial fly catcher to fix that problem completely. Toni doesn't impress easily, but she chowed down on her plate and said it was really good, which to me is one of the higher compliments you could get out of Toni. \n\nToni also had bits off of my plate which came with the same salad, beans, rice combo but with carne asada, sauteed shrimp and veggies. I am very picky about my rice and beans but the entire time I could only think about the dedication and time it takes to get large amounts of rice and beans exactly to the quality I received that day.\n\nOf course, while there, I only saw the older lady, and heard no one else having conversations in the back around the kitchen. I didn't know if they had a cook or another employee but it felt as though it was just the older lady, Toni amd myself. We might have been there in a slow time, but this place was empty and for what I just had, it didn't reflect the crowd to quality ratio in my opinion. \n\nAt the end of it all, I had two large mugs of Tejuino and as I was paying our bill which was fair for what we had, I ordered a Tejuino to go. Knowing that it was going to be a long time before I would be to the east side of Las Vegas and enjoy the restaurant again from La Reyna but I knew it was worth the trip for the awesome food we had.\n\nIf you want to try or get Tejuino and equally great authentic dishes from Mexico, I recommend La Reyna. The small things that were a negative to us were overshadowed by the quality of food you receive.

Yeah, I know, not all pubs are battered, but there is a distinct feel of age and wear in even the cleanest of them.  The service was okay--the waitress had a few too many tables to handle well, and that's not her fault.  The food was decent as well--I had bangers and mash.  Unfortunately, it wasn't as authentic as I would have liked.  The bangers were dead on--with thin, crisp skins and nice fatty pork inside.  The mash was made from real potatoes, not instant potatoes, but the cabbage was some bright green stuff (or was that parsley?).  The gravy had a very red-wine flavor--lovely, but not traditional.  And the peas?  The frozen green things, not proper marrowfat peas.  It was the sort of interpretation that will and should appeal to Americans who haven't gone to English schools in the UK.

They have this awesome happy hour deal that everything on the all you can eat menu is 50% off, but since there was 8 of us, 3 of us decided to still get the AYCE. Everything was pretty good, except for the rice. My dad who I didn't think had a fine palatte commented on it first. Other than that, everything was pretty good. They didn't have enough Unagi defrosted so that bummed my aunt out. The sweet shrimp didn't come with a deep fried head which was a first for me, but I guess I can live without that. As I stated earlier, the hostess has always been really friendly so when it was time to bring the cake out for my brother, they played some techno version of Happy Birthday with the lights turned  off and everything. My poor brother was probably mortified, but I thought it was pretty funny. I'm sure he won't ever forget his 18th birthday now.

We were all able to fit in the big booth and cozy up with one another since it was a very rainy night. It wasn't busy at all when we got there and we were seated right away. I briefly browsed through the menu and I was surprised that they had AYCE. You know me and my sushi fetish, BUT I was not hungry enough to do AYCE. I ended up getting the shrimp tempura udon, halibut nigri and a roll. The halibut was fresh and the roll was pretty delicious. It made me wish that I had gotten the AYCE. The shrimp tempura udon came out piping hot and the tempura was a vsriety of 2 shrimps, carrots, broccoli, cucumber and sweet potato? I felt the price and what you got was definitely reasonable. Unlike most places though, the udon and broth is just that..some places add crab cake and seaweed flakes but this was just plain and simple. My aunt had ordered a couple of rolls and I ended up trying the 911. Let me tell you it was 911 spicy! but delicious in a way. The bf went with the chicken teriyaki dinner and although it was oversauced he said it was good. Service was attentive and everything came out fairly quickly.

Most AYCE do not offer a children's menu besides bento boxes. So paying for children @ an AYCE would not be  worth it. So, I thought this place would be excellent since you can buy sushi  al a carte which was also 50% off! That deserves a star, perfect for a small appetite whether a child or an adult.  \n\n\nWe walked in, were greeted right away and sat at a table. We waited about 10-15 mins before our server acknowledge us again to take our drink order. Finally after about 25 mins of being there I get to finally give my sushi order. She looked at us weird because I ordered my children sushi, whom like I've mentioned were under 5. The wait time was ridiculous being that their were only 2 other tables besides us. I never got my beverage refilled my entire meal.  The sushi was OK, I've had better. The spider roll was average the crab wasn't fresh, pre-cooked before ordering. Yuck! So there was no crunch. The tempura roll tasted exactly the same. My children ordered Ebi Nigiri which took 15 mins to come out, I have no idea how hard it is to slap shrimp on rice?! Anyways, when you tasted just the rice there wasn't any flavor as other places I've gone too. \n\nToward the end of my meal they ran out of rice and was told I'd have to wait 25 mins before I can order my next roll. I gave up! Ordered some yummy mochi ice cream, which of course were store bought, no big deal. \n\nSo overall, I'd come back again if it were just me and the kids and we want cheap sushi.

It tastes unusually chewy and the texture threw me off. The peanut sauce looks home-made because it is extra chunky, which I enjoyed much more. Other than the uber-great peanut sauce, nothing too special about the spring rolls.\n\nThe shrimp noodle bowl was pretty good, but for some reason the noodles were clumped together and looked unprepared. They give you a huge serving, but when about half of it is clumped noodle, it isn't as appealing. Ugh.\n\nThankfully, I really enjoyed the pho. The broth is on the oily side, but it was overkill. For others it may be too much, but the flavors in the broth was very delicious. I like to load my broth with many scoops of the pepper paste and usually the broth dilutes rather quickly. However, you can still taste the broth beyond the pepper paste. Pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe other dishes are a hit and miss, I definitely won't order the spring rolls again.

I personally think and hour at a casual dinning establishment is more than enough time to sit, eat, pay the bill and leave but I guess I was thinking the wrong thing in this instance.  \n\nWe were greeted by the hostess and seated quickly.

Here's the FB post:\n\"EVENT ON SATURDAY JANUARY 18, 2014!\nThis event is to save 9 on the Plate! I am your charity case now! I have no shame  I have never asked for anything when it came to my business and my restaurant, but now I am. HELP ME! Come and enjoy good food, good drinks, with great company!\"\n\nWell, from the good reviews, the fact that there was a restaurant.com coupon available, and the owner was literally begging for business, I had dinner with Yelp family there on Saturday night, the 18th of January.\nFirst impressions walking in were that the place is very elegant and much attention to detail was paid in the decor.  It's located in the Von's shopping plaza at Desert Inn and Durango, next to Easy Life Boba.  When Shirley, Tim, and I arrived at 7:00pm, there were only two other parties in the whole restaurant--uh oh.  No wonder they needed help.  The good news is that by the time we left, the place was full, so that Facebook post must have helped.\n\nThe three of us each chose two dishes:\n-Spam and Egg Fried Rice (Tim)\n-Crispy Bulgogi (Tim)\n-Vegetable Curry (Shirley)\n-Pot Stickers (Shirley)\n-Kalbi (me)\n-Honey Chicken Wings (me)\n\nI loved the chicken wings and the kalbi.  The Spam fried rice was good, but I stole some of Shirley's white rice from her curry dish to eat with my kalbi.  The bulgogi was ok, but there was not a whole lot of it.  I didn't try the pot stickers because Shirley said they were spicy and there were only two of them; they looked more like empanadas than pot stickers to me. She only ate one of them, Tim nor I wanted the other one, so one got left behind.\n\nService was wonderful and the staff was very pleasant.  Most of the dishes were $10 and I agree with some other reviews that for the price, you should get more food.  I guess I can't complain too much because we used the restaurant.com certificate that I had, which took $15 off our $63 bill.

That's not what really happen, but it was something like that. Everything was a blur up until now. Crap, I think i even just pee'd a little.\n\nUpon entry this restaurant is contemporary. A large layout with several compartments.  A bar over here, a little room over there, and of course the main room.  I had no idea what the whole concept was about; however, Jae, our server, was very helpful and offered some great suggestions.  The menu is simple yet sophisticated serving modern dishes as well as traditional Korean dishes with a twist.  Plenty of solid choices:\n\nFried Chicken $10:  Loose pieces of Fried Ck perfectly battered over two piece of butterhead lettuce, mountain of julienne scallions, and a drizzle of sesame dressing.  I really like this dish, but deep down i was begging for more of that sesame sauce. Just a bit more, so i don't have to clean the plate with my chicken bits. For some odd reason the taste reminded me of Mc'D ck nuggets but better.\n\nBulgogi Sliders $8:  Perfectly marinated beef in a brioche.  Good but for 8 dollars they should either add a 3rd slider or make it more meatier so you don't have to have a mouthful of bread.  Comes with Ruffle Chips.  I didn't bother to try but it better be made in house.\n\nSpicy Korean Pork Tacos $9:  What a surprise this was!  Has an creamy avocado sour cream sauce, kimchi chutney (says in the description in the menu), and a special ssam sauce (that reddish Korean paste that you wrap your BBQ and lettuce in.)  All that in a taco and it naturally work.  If this was the only item served here i would not be mad at all.  No water?? That's OK, I'll get a drink later!   Oh and the weird thing was the Ruffle Chips somehow made its way onto this plate too.  Who's in charge here?!\n\nBossam (traditional) $10:  Braised Pork Belly.  I don't know how this was supposed to taste like but i thoroughly enjoyed it.  Sweet and bold fatty flavor in every bite and even better paired with the pickled radish.\n\nBraised Short Ribs (traditional) $13: I couldn't taste much of this because they sprinkle some pine nuts all over it gAaahh.  It looked rather small and the meat didn't seem that tender.  I had a little taste and resembled beef stew.  \n\nAlthough for $10 a plate we're not getting much portion wise, but for the most part the imprints of the food left me curious for more.  I'm already excited for my next visit.  Would love to see a happy hour menu, and daily specials in the near future.\n\n4/5 easy.

One of the staff (possibly the owner?) walked me through the steps it took to create this flavorful masterpiece.  Totaling a three to four hour process, pork tenderloin is first rolled inside pork belly, then cooked rotisserie-style, and sliced up into juicy, tender pieces.  These are tossed into a fresh, chewy baguette slathered with a lemon caper gremolata spread and some greens.

This is the reason why you get 3 stars guys....if the pizza wasn't good here, this would be an easy ONE star joint.\n\nThe pizza is amazingly tasty.  The crust is super flavorful and soft.  The sauce is awesome and tastes great.  There is a thick layer of melted cheese that hides under all that sauce.  Very good Chicago style pizza...best I have tried so far.  The pizza is an easy 4.5-5/5 in my book...from end to end.  It barely fits inside the pizza box, which is a good sign.\n\nBut there are many more negatives to this place that outweigh the good...\n\nFirst off all, the place is a bar, and smells like a bar.  Not a huge deal for me personally, but I would not bring my baby boy here to eat.  I had to go to the bar to get my takeout, since the \"restaurant\" side had nobody there...nobody to greet in front.  Again, since it is a bar, it's not a big deal to me, but if you come here expecting Metro Pizza/ Grimaldis, think again.\n\nThe sauce on top is not very aesthetically pleasing to the eye....I felt weird about taking the pic to show my friends, and realized that without eating it, it wouldn't look very yummy.  Not important to me, but some people eat with their eyes.  And because the sauce is all on top, the drive home (takeout) made the entire pizza's sauce slide to one side....I had to \"paint\" it all back on to eat it. \n\nIt is also pretty expensive.  I ordered a small with 2 toppings, and after tax, it was a $20 bill.  Take everything I just said negatively, and then you can see why I feel as though it is overpriced.\n\nLast thing....I ordered fresh garlic and pepperoni.  The garlic is most likely minced....can't really see it there, but you can taste it.  But the pepperoni wasn't there!  I am a dumbass and presumed that it was hiding under all that cheese and sauce, but after biting into it, there was no pep. (I didn't bother calling in to complain)  There was NO one at the restaurant, and I guarantee there was NO one else calling in an order at the time, so how can you get my order wrong?  How can you forget the main topping to my pizza??\n\nThe sad thing is, the pizza was so good, that I can still see myself ordering to go again, just triple checking my order before I leave.", "business_id": "w3oV0d-i7KHJqvS4hKxk5A", "stars": 3, "date": "2012-12-15", "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "Aqv5HpQw0Ua0eZeCq3TuXg", "review_id": "pXXucyycs7hQXVV9XsTrhw", "text": "When it was LaGolisita stopped going there.

If you didn't know the kitchen was serving up Chicago style eats you'd expect this to be just another neighborhood video poker bar.\n\nFriends, also from Chicago, joined us for dinner. We were seated in the main dining floor, booths line the walls above those is old photos of the rat pack and such. Next to the main dining area there was a crooner singing old Sinatra tunes. A bit too loud, in our opinion. It was hard to carry on a conversation.\n\nWe looked over the menu and decided to try a bit of all the flavors we miss from our old home. We started with sagnaki and mozzarella sticks. The sagnaki was lit tableside, our waiter fumbled a bit to put out the flames. The cheese was floating in liquid so I was expecting it to taste like pure alcohol, but it did not. The sagnaki was good, but the pita bread was a bit stale. I didn't try the mozzarella sticks, but I didn't hear any complaints. Next, our friends had minestrone which was a decent version but served too cold.\n\nThe was a lull between our starters and main course. The staff was very apologetic. The owner came by a couple times. We were content and understanding. \n\nMeanwhile, the crooner came by and attempted to hustle for tips. He walked up and made some comment about how his jar was clean and eager awaited a tip. When we declined, he walked off in a huff and said  \"I'm a cub fan anyway.\" Okay, buddy, good for you. We would've happily dropped a few bucks in his jar when we finished our meal, but to interrupt us and solicit so rudely, it was unreal. We sat in awe. Did that really just happen?\n\nThen, everything began to unravel. The staff seemed more and more overwhelmed as more diners filled the restaurant. You could hear shouting coming from the kitchen over the tunes playing in the room next to us.\n\nOur gyro, hot dog and fries were brought out, but again we received apologies for the delay on the pizza. It would be up in a few. \n\nIt had all the makings of a chicago dog so it had promise, but the hot dog was so shriveled and dry it was not enticing, the bun was stale. Sad to say, but  the pickle & sport peppers were the highlight. I love athenian fries, their version called Zante  fries were ok. I prefer the feta evenly distributed and heated until melty and bubbly.      \n\nI didn't sample the gyro but my husband wasn't a fan. At first, he wondered if tzatziki had been left off because it was just a small dollop underneath the meat, but then he was left wishing it was forgotten, He said the taste was not good at all. \n\nOur friends pizza had mushrooms, onions, and half sausage and pepperoni. The crust was uber thin, similar to some styles in Chicago. The slice I tried lacked any pepperoni or sausage, yet it was very greasy. Mushrooms and onions shouldn't be greasy. The sauce was too sweet and acidic for my liking.\n\nThe service was attentive and they tried with the food, but execution was flawed and getting hustled for tips just killed the experience. It was so off-putting. Over the years, Vegas has collected a good number of Chicago style joints, the competition is pretty stiff.

Not being in a rush, we said we'd wait & got our pastrami sandwich & drink. After waiting about 15 minutes I decide to check with the person we ordered from if the hot dogs were ready. I was then told that they don't have hot dogs. Confused, I reiterated what I was told earlier about waiting for the buns but was ignored & told that they don't have either. Another worker had showed up & entered our conversation asking, \"do you REALLY want a hot dog?\", which to me says, \"we're closing soon & we don't really want to correct what we did wrong, but I'll offer it up with a bit of sarcasm anyway\".  That also pissed me off just a bit. So, I ended up eating the other half of the pastrami sandwich (which was ok, not the best pastrami ever, by any means). Had I been originally told that they were out I would have just ordered something else & not have anything to grumble about. Buuuuuut, this was not the case which caused me some major irritation.\n\nSo, food is ok, service is terrible. I'd much rather go to the cafe in the Cal.

I finally noticed a guy sitting inside. \n\n10 minutes later and about two minutes after the guy in front of me got his food and pulled away, the gentlemen comes over the speaker and says go ahead. I order the Camaro burger with cheese, fries and a strawberry shake.  All is good and I pull up to the window. \n\n25 minutes later I get a guy at the window handing me a bag with my burger and fries and says. That was a vanilla shake right?  I politely tell him it was strawberry and he says ok and disappears again. A couple minutes later he appears by the shake blender with the phone in his ear and proceeds to make the shake. I can see that there is no strawberry in the blender and thought that this was odd. Then he opens it up and pours strawberry syrup in the blender and continues\n\nI ordered the strawberry shake because the sign says \"made the old fashion way\". Maybe it's me but the old fashion way would have fruit and not some artificial flavoring...\n\nAfter I get my good I remind the guy at the drive thru that I need to pay and he takes my card.

The one thing I really liked is that the pork two ways was pulled pork and definitely added to the flavor. \n\nThe second time I came here I ordered the same thing because I loved it so much but I also ordered one of their Pineapple- Guava Che, not knowing what a Che is.. Words of wisdom on this one, don't order something if you don't know what it is. This drink had everything but the kitchen sink in it- from beans, to mochi balls, to peanuts, and some guava and pineapple, who knows what else was in there though.. So besides the drink, which was drinkable- minus the beans, Mainland is amazing.  Their decor is  by Paris-based designer India Mahdavi, which is gorgeous. His design is clean, chic, and modern.

My friends have really enjoyed Fado for lunch in the past and so I thought I would give it a try for St. Paddy's.  Probably a mistake going to a very busy Irish pub on St. Patrick's Day but I thought it would be fun to check out the live music under the tent and reasonably priced Killian's Irish Red.  It wasn't the immense crowd that make me unhappy, but the fact that on a day when Fado knows they are going to be turning a huge profit, they still charged a $15 cover charge just to get in and wait in line for 20 minutes for a cup of beer.  In principle I usually refuse to pay a cover charge but my friends and I had already made plans to meet another friend there and so we felt obligated to stay.  Plus, the doorman said that I would be receiving a $10 gift card for entering, really only making my cover charge $5.  Too bad he didn't mention that you had to spend $20 on items other than alcohol in order to get the $10 discount.  That's not called a gift certificate, that is a coupon.  By the time my other friend arrived only 30 minutes after I did, the line was so long (around the block!) that she would have to wait at least an hour to enter, so all of us ended up leaving and going to another restaurant/bar.  $15 per head cover when you already know you are going to turn a huge profit is just greedy.  On a positive note, there was no line for the ladies room inside of the bar due to the crowd control at the door. Perhaps contributing to my negative attitude is the fact that I am possibly just getting too old for this kind of experience, with the meat-market atmosphere and drunk idiots everywhere.

With tabs like \"What's Inside a Meal?\" and \"Delivery Process,\" I was able to gather all of the information I needed on what expectations to have regarding service as well as any concerns I had in mind about quality of food. And, I will say, I was pleasantly surprised with one piece of information in particular: during high season, I should expect to receive my delivery at least 30-60 early. Wow!!\n\nWithout further-a-do, I immediately began to place my order online. The selection was huge, and I was happy to see that the prices were fair. Here's a tip: You can find ALL of their options ranging from individual items to full-out diet plans by simply clicking the \"Click To Order\" tab.\n\nFinally, the best part of all was the delivery. I was greeted on-time by the owner herself at my doorstep and welcomed to Modern Proteins. So sweet! I found Mina to be professional and friendly, and was invited to connect with her via email about further ways to tailor my diet according to my needs. The food was INCREDIBLE!!

He's so appreciative of your business and checks back constantly during your stay to make sure everything is satisfactory. \n\nFor starters, we tried cheese bread, mozzarella sticks and chicken wings. The bread was amazing and topped with melted mozzarella cheese, very delicious and crisp. I simply LOVE mozzarella sticks and these were really delicious - crisp on the outside and gooey stringy yummy cheese on the inside, accompanied by tasty marinara. My dad and friend ate the chicken wings, and this is the first time I've ever seen dad eat wings. He said they were delicious (they must have been, he ate most of them in 5 minutes.) The owner said they bake them, then deep fry them, and they are served with a buffalo sauce. \n\nWe ordered two medium thin crust pizzas, one with half cheese/half black olives (my favorite) and one with sausage. Crust is cooked to perfection, just the right amount of flavor and crispness, and that pizza sauce is amazing. Just the right amount of cheese, too. SO. DARN.GOOD!!!! Planning on having the pizza posse meetup group here in a few weeks to try the deep dish. \n\nBut..don't take MY word for it.

It was obvious as underneath there was still some seasoning underneath. The steak was now burned not the medium well that was ordered it was well done and burned.

So I ate everything: Banana beignets, waffles with maple-bacon butter and syrup, velvet cake served sandwich style, apple coffee cake, a banana nut muffin topped with nutella, and monkey bread. My favorite was pretzels served with a mustard seed/orange butter; I may have the ingredients mixed up but the flavor was perfect. Everything was delicious. \n\nIf you missed the truck today, see them on Monday, Oct. 11 at the Metro Pizza on Tropicanna and Maryland Parkway. Sounds like Lulu's will adjust the portion sizes a bit and sell most items at reasonable prices. I suggest it as breakfast or lunchtime dessert for my coworkers at UNLV.\n\nThe truck also sells cookies, popcorn and other take-away snacks. The service was great. Food was excellent. The only reason it gets four stars instead of five is because I don't know their regular prices and I might be a little bias due to the $1-dollar-deals today.", "business_id": "keBXqRRumQA-A5m4K7Zq5w", "stars": 4, "date": "2010-10-10", "useful": 7, "cool": 2}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "t21dZOntAXHdkrlw80hDCg", "review_id": "469KVmAQmoGCyuUu5CHBxg", "text": "Amazing sushi & friendly staff.

Maybe it will get you some type of badge.\n\nAs everybody knows, the Costco Food Court has some of the best tasting food at prices that everybody loves! Let's see, you got your choice of either a Polish or All American Hot Dog that comes with a drink for $1.50! Can I get an AMEN! A Chicken Bake for $2.99, a Toasted Ciabatta Turkey Sandwich for $3.99, and some other items that catch your eye as well like a huge slice of either Cheese, Pepperoni, or Combination pizza for umm......damn I cant remember cuz I only order it for my kids.\n\nAnyways, you guys get what im saying. They have something for everybody and its not too hard on your wallet. I say the price you pay for the membership alone is worth it just for the food court!\n\nThe only downfall that irks me is that they only take cash. You would think that since you can pay with either debit or American Express at the front registers that these guys would have the same set up. NOT! Although you can pay for whatever you wanna get at the food court at the front registers is a little better, that still is kind of a hassle.\n\nIn the end, I have yet to have a bad experience with the service and food every time I eat here.

And unfortunately, it will probably be the last. Maybe that's not fair. I'll explain.\n\nI first dined at Company back in June. My party of six was seated by a waiter and looked after very attentively by three support servers clad all black pants, collared shirts and aprons. I felt a little under-dressed. The menu was upscale comfort food. My friend Katie gave me part of her delicious lobster BLT. My friend Colton gave me two spoonfuls of deliciously creamy mashed potatoes and the best creamed spinach I have ever had. I had the special that night, which was the jambalaya. It was fantastic. And there was so much of it, I couldn't even finish it all. Overall, I had a great experience and vowed to return.\n\nOver Thanksgiving weekend, I found out that a friend and I  would be staying at the Luxor for the Criss Angel show Believe (see that review before you go). I quickly made reservations for Company. I couldn't wait to show off this place that I \"knew\". And I wore a jacket and nice shoes this time too. \n\nThe restaurant looked exactly the same as it did in June. Only now the waiters were clad in black t-shirts that had the word \"Company\" silkscreened across them. The very friendly waiter asked if I had dined here before. I proudly told him \"Yes. Last June.\" To which he said \"Oh. So you were here before our concept change.\" Concept change? Uh boy. He continued his rotely memorized patter \"What our concept is now is that we take classic Western dishes and we combine them with Eastern ingredients to deliver small tasting plates with great variety.\" My heart and stomach sank. \"So this is like an East/West tapas menu? Right?\" To which he said \"I'm glad you said that. That's a very good way of describing it.\" I checked in with my friend. It wasn't a deal breaker for him. So we soldiered on.\n\nThe menu is divided into four sections: Sea, Sky, Land and Earth. We both ordered an item from each category.\n\nSEA: Seared Tuna w/ lemon, olive oil, wasabi greens - There was so little of this dish, I barely remember it.\nLumb Crab Gratin w/shitake mushroom, bacon, leek and cotija cheese- This was really good. I'd like another portion of this. And to top it off, it was served in the same cast iron gratin dish that they used to serve the creamed spinach in. WHERE ARE YOU CREAMED SPINACH?\n\nSKY: Organic Duck Confit Potstickers- They were okay. I've never understood why you would hide duck confit in a potsticker that you are going to dip in a sauce.\nChicken Breast w/mushroom ragout- The Eleanor Rigby  of this menu\n\nLAND: SoHo Kobe Beef Slider- Very good. But their current prevalence on so many gastropub menus didn't make me feel like it was anything terribly special. \nFilet of Beef w/brandy cream and melted leek- Good. Not really sure what a melted leek is though, either before or after I ate it.\n\nEARTH: Gruyere Cheese Puffs w/chive creme fraiche and lobster oil- On the dry side. This was the one dish that remained the longest on the table due to neither of us fighting over it.\nChili Garlic Asparagus- Really good. Strands of baby asparagus. Glad it came out with the steak too.\n\nOverall, it was good food. After finishing all of the entrees, the waiter asked if we were still hungry. I answered with a qualified YES. He offered to bring the menu back. But I was thinking more about walking across the street to the Dan Marino Steakhouse at Hooters. Now THERE'S fine dining ;-). I capped off the meal with a dessert of Earl Grey chocolate cake with almond ice cream. SOOOOOO TINY. \n\nI guess I'd go to Company again. But I'd only bring a certain group of people with me. Their concept change has radically changed my concept of dining there. Good place for foodies to knock off a bunch of plates.

We didn't know what we wanted, but the girl taking our order helped us out. We got the vegetarian combo with the grilled beef (see my picture). \n\nThe beef was wonderful! It is seasoned and spicy, but not super spicy. The beef was served in the middle with all the vegetarian goodies out the outer part of the platter. The vegetarian dishes were super delicious as well. It was a lot of beans, dips, potatoes and spinach. \n\nThey serve the platter with a basket of Ethiopian flat bread (called Injera). There is no silverware or utensils, you unroll the Injera and pull off a section, then pick up the beef and other sides with the bread. The Injera is a spongy kind of bread with almost no flavor, it has more of a practical purpose. That platter of beef and the sides was more than enough for my wife and myself. Very filling and absolutely delicious.\n\nOne thing to note is that there was no ice. This has also been my experience in Indian restaurants as well.

It's a small restaurant in Town Square. The place wasn't busy at all so it took no time to get seated. Our waitress was very friendly and almost too attentive (stopping by every 5 minutes almost). Their menu is pretty limited and they specialize in coal fired pizza (who would have guessed). There are signs all over the restaurant that will let you know that your pizza will be \"well done\" -- meaning the bottom may look a little black and burnt but the top will be perfect.  And, that's exactly how it came out. The crust was thin and crunchy and the top was a little too greasy but that was from all the pepperoni. It tasted really good and the salad we had was also good -- nothing spectacular but still solid. The pizzas are more traditional than what you would find at places like CPK or Sammy's (\"gourmet\" pies) so it was a nice change of pace to get something old school like that without having to go to a crappy pizza place like pizza hut or domino's. There is no kid's menu, but that didn't really matter since we all shared one pizza.

Unfortunately, I only have that one experience upon which to base my assessment of Pyarr. \n\nLocated in Village Square, just a few doors down from the Regal Cinemas, Pyarr is relatively new, and its obvious it hasn't built up its clientele yet. I visited during the lunch buffet with a friend one weekday, and we were the only other people dining in there aside from one guy at his lonely table. Seating was open, but we were promptly greeted and quickly brought water as our drink orders were being taken, which left us to hit up the buffet.\n\nOf course, this is where my review gets highly subjective. The buffet selection was, let's say, not impressive. Especially not if you're a vegetarian (hello!). There were only eight-to-10 hot plates from which to choose, and none of these were fried goodies such as samosa, pakora or papadum. The selection does change daily, but I'd rather see Pyarr ixnay the bulk of its mostly ignored cold condiment selections to make room for more hot stuff. And maybe they will when business picks up.\n\nThe buffet does include a serving of their fresh naan, however, and I will say this: I think this is the best naan I've had in Vegas, even counting my beloved India Palace. And even though the selection was weak, the food I did have (jeera rice, aloo palak, yellow daal) was tasty and just spicy enough.\n\nThe service was excellent. We were being checked up on regularly, asked for feedback on specific dishes, re-filled with beverages (maybe not accurately, but ...), etc. Again, this might have been because we were the only people in the joint, but hey, it's something.\n\nEither way, I plan to come back to explore the menu further during dinner hours, so I can maybe give a more well-rounded review.", "business_id": "VNOz_tOw_Hz3FAJeEHb_yg", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-08-15", "useful": 2, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "FZNKwUSXvpv6dMQssaMqwg", "review_id": "H7bh2vP24Hux8iwVuhg_6A", "text": "My girlfriend and I tried this restaurant when it first opened.

A few months later, the business had closed, so I guess we weren't alone in our distaste.\n\nRecently, however, new owners took over the Saucy Tomato, so we decided to give it another try. And I'm glad we did. It's a nice, clean little place with plenty of seating in booths or at the bar. There's a definite \"family\" vibe going on with the staff, and they make you feel very welcome. Even though it's a very casual place, the server/hostess/mistress of ceremonies made sure we we taken care of and very comfortable.\n\nWe ordered a thin crust pizza (split between cheese and pepperoni) and a large house salad. The salad, while nothing too impressive, was large enough for two of us to share without finishing it all, and the creamy garlic dressing was tasty. The pizza? SO MUCH BETTER than whatever nonsense the previous owners were baking. There was a good balance of sauce and cheese, the crust was crispy but not hard, and it came out a lot faster than promised.\n\nWe probably walked out of there for less than $20, which isn't a bad deal for dinner for two on a Saturday night.

Other stuff like guacamole and sour cream is extra. The only complaint is that the tortillas were limp and a little soggy.

Cooked perfectly and tasted great.\n\n- Baked Goat Cheese: goat cheese surrounded with marinara. Comes with garlic toast. Nicolle brought out more bread when she saw we were out. It was a good dish but nothing spectacular.\n\n- Cheese Quesadilla: large enough for sharing with a few people. Tasted good.\n\n- Crab cake sliders: decent bits of crab, with lemon aioli, not too much filler. They were a little dry but tasty. I still haven't had great crab cakes in this city. The fried onions were pretty sad -- tiny stringy pieces of onions that were over fried.\n\nSome of the wines were decent. Beer was good. Food is about 3 stars, service was 5 stars.

I didn't know what to expect when I parked my bike up to the entrance but as soon as I got in there I knew it was the place to be. It's buffet meets fast food meets restaurant service, and that combination with the customer service is terrific. Totally affordable, quick, and easy.\n\nWent inside and it has really good use of space, and has a modern feel to it and plenty of areas to sit. I obviously looked slightly lost as I went up to the counter area, but the cook greeted me and asked me if it was my first time there, which it was. He showed me around and told me I could make pretty much anything I wanted. I paid first ($6.99 for a vegetarian bowl), got handed a bowl, and went to town. You go down the buffet and you have a ton of veggies and toppings to choose from. From what I could tell, my meal was completely vegan (until I put honey on the AMAZING sesame flatbread, YUM!) and all the ingredients were super fresh. I picked out some tofu, bean sprouts, zucchini, onion, snow peas, green pepper, and mushrooms. I added some garlic sauce on top, and handed it off to the cook who added some noodles and other sauces (he asked me first if I wanted it spicy, and I declined) and then added it to the big wok behind the counter. Eventually this small bowl I was handed turned into this giant plate that was also served with a side of white rice. He handed the plate to me, and told me to sit anywhere I like. \n\nAfter grabbing some chopsticks (don't do it, just eat with a fork - trust me) and some napkins, almost immediately after sitting down I was served the aforementioned sesame flatbread with honey, and a glass of ice water. Freakin' nice. And the food? DELICIOUS. The past few weeks I haven't had much of an appetite, but I ate the whole damn plate. And the bread. And downed the water. It was very tasty and left me really satisfied with the different flavorings of everything. \n\nThis place gets 5 stars for service, convenience, price, cleanliness, and it's only a 5 minute bike ride from my apartment. Epic win! I will definitely be coming back with some friends and some cash to tip the next time because the service really is excellent. Just be really careful, you may be so full that you can't Wok-On-Out!\n\nP.S. As I sat down they played Lady Gaga. As I left they played Katy Perry.

I asked for a veggie plate hibachi-style, and edamame. This came with vegan fried rice (!!!), sprouts, onion, and zucchini on the biggest plate I've ever seen, and a salad with ginger dressing. The edamame was really good and everything came out steaming hot. I didn't think I would finish all of my food but lo and behold, I did. I ate about 7 fistfuls of vegetables in one sitting, plus ice cream. Wow. \n\nMy friend ordered the teriyaki steak and some sushi, and he really enjoyed the steak so much that he had to slow himself down and enjoy it. \n\nCome here if you want ridiculously good food at very decent prices, with service that is hard to match at most other restaurants.

The brat was perfectly cooked and the oscar was fairly well executed. My friends loved the roll it was dressed in.

Here's the dealio:\n\nHave been here twice within a span of two days. I went to the one in Baker as well.

The sauce was meant to hide the fact that it was not, in fact, grilled. It looked steamed, if that, and had a bit of an odd texture.\n\nNo fried rice because the grills were turned off... so they can't cook some up in the kitchen with the rest of the hot food? No sushi, either.

We drank it to mask the taste (or lack thereof) of the food.

No other pizza chain sells better pizza then papa Murphy's.  I feel the reason why they can afford better quality ingredients is because the business saves a ton of money not having to pay for the repair, maintenance, and upkeep of a pizza oven!  Pizza ovens are on all day to keep them preheated.  That's a lot of overhead costs in natural gas bill!  Not only that but the electric bill will still be sky high.  Because if you have several gas pizza ovens running all day you must keep the air conditioner running constantly too cool off the kitchen.

She used to work at the old Barbary Coast many years ago, and she said at the time it was a pretty damn good steakouse.  We decided to try it out.\n\nWe weren't real hungry, so we split everything. We started with a wedge salad that was as perfect as it gets - no bleu cheese dressing at all, but plenty of crumbles. A balsamic reduction that was to die for and plenty of tomatoes (yum) and onions (yuk) without anything stupid like sunflower seeds or sprouts or some of the other ridiculous things I've seen idiot chefs trying to make a name for themselves throw onto a wedge salad to make it \"theirs.\" They can keep it. This one was the epitome of wedge salad perfection, and it was cold, fresh and delicious.\n\nThis was quickly followed by two awesome crab cakes - light and flaky with a bit more of a crust on them than most, which I liked. We finished up with an order of crab legs, and again I don't think I've ever had better in Vegas.  They were absolutely huge and melted in your mouth after a good drenching of butter.  No breaking up into tiny pieces or tearing when trying to get the meat out of the shells either, so it wasn't even a task to eat - the only thing I usually don't like about crab legs.\n\nWe ate here the night before they closed for the holidays.  When our waiter asked if we wanted wine we stalled, and he quickly told us that he had about four bottles open that he would have to throw away if someone didn't finish them, so he'd offer us a glass or two at half price. Sold! She had two, and I had one giant one.\n\nWe get done & order bananas foster because it's her favorite, but alas the late hour and fact that they're closing for two weeks after we leave conspire to thwart our culinary plans for dessert. A little bit of a bummer until the waiter tells us he'll just comp the wine completely to make up for it!\n\nWe both ate and were stuffed on salad, crab cakes and crab legs with 3 to 4 glasses of wine (depending on how you count mine) in a quiet, intimate fine-dining atmosphere in a Vegas strip resort for under $60.00 total, INCLUDING TIP!  I still feel like I hit the damn lottery on that one.  Wish I could go out for a meal like this at a price like that every day. \n\nWe'll be back to try the steaks & I'll update then, but for now I'll just thank my lucky stars we were in the right place at the right time with the right waiter.

We were staying at the Bluegreen resort for the first time and saw their flyer in our room. After missing lunch with our friends, we were starving and called down to order. We did walk past the door twice, but then darted in and watched the owner bake our pizzas. He was really nice and chit-chatted with us while we were standing there. I loved the layout of the place. There is nowhere to sit, but he has glass up almost like a sub sandwich place for protection of the food, and so you can see the whole place. It was really neat standing there and watching our pizza cook and brown and watch the owner work the oven. You could tell this is what he does and has a passion for. Here's what we ordered and what we thought:\n\nCheese Pizza: Simple cheese pizza, done amazingly right. The owner pulled it out of the wood fire oven and it already looked amazing, but then he did a spiral of some kind of sauce. We brought it up to our room and started to devour it. My word, I have never had such a tasteful pizza. It was thin, which I normally don't like, but I loved this one! The flavor of the dough was great, and the wood fire taste imbedded in it was perfect. The cheese, the sauce, I didn't NOT like anything about this pizza.\n\nPepperoni Pizza: Basically everything I said about the cheese, transfers to the Pepperoni as well. The flavors were amazing and the owner uses little pepperoni's instead of the large ones. I loved them so much! The meat had such great flavor and wasn't spicy like some can be either. I couldn't make up my mind if I wanted the cheese or the pep more. YUM!\n\nWhile talking with the owner waiting for our pizzas he told us that he special orders his dough from New Jersey because the water here is too hard and doesn't make the dough the same. That information itself shows how much he cares about his product and that he knows his stuff. Every time we go to Vegas we will be stopping by here again.

Went for a quick bite and went to a place we love by our house... \"The Sushi\" was amazing: great chefs, good ambiance, fantastic service.  Tonight the door had a new sign, but same menu which was suspect.  The place was very loud and busy, like a family and friends party at the bar.  We got our drinks (water) and ordered a couple AYCE items.  Seaweed salad and gyoza were fine, but once our nigiri came out (not exactly what we ordered but hey, close enough) we still were waiting on plates, wasabi, soy sauce, etc. We attempted multiple times to flag anyone down to no avail (just to ask for some plates and wasabi) but were awkwardly avoided.\n\nNo kidding 15 minutes goes by and we're still trying to flag someone down the whole time.  The nigiri is just sitting there while waving and attempting to flag down anyone working.  15+ minutes with no service at an AYCE is terrible.  Empty waters, no service, nothing to eat our sushi with.  Meanwhile the party at the bar continues with the chefs doing shots with friends at the bar.  Our maybe waiter who greeted and sat us was polite and running around trying to keep up with the 4-5 other tables, but continued to avoid us even after saying he would be \"right back\" 15 or so minutes after we flagged him down. \n\nBottom line, this place needs to get their game together if they want to stay open.

This is a small, family-owned pizzeria. It's got an average sized menu of all of the normal pizzeria fare, plus some greek options like gyros. They seem to have lots of options for cutting your bill down like daily specials, coupons, and Groupon-Now. They've got a TV on in the dining area, it's clean. Not a whole lot really stands this place out from the rest when you look at the basic facts, but one thing will bring me back in the future: their service. \n\nI purchased a Groupon-Now deal on my smart phone and drove to the location specified. I nearly passed it because it's tucked away behind a gas station. I walked in and was instantly greeted. I like that, by the way. There was a young gentleman and an older one behind the counter and both were extremely polite. I settled on a gyro and a vegetarian pizza. Prices were really reasonable, I'd be back for daily specials etc. in the future. \n\nAfter ordering I was asked if I wanted the gyro to come out at the same time as the pizza, or if I wanted to eat while the pizza was being cooked (they knew the pizza was mainly for my coworkers and the gyro was for me). How curteous! I agreed on eating the gyro while waiting for the pizza. It was brought out to me in a basket, a filling portion with yummy seasoned fries. The dressing for the gyro came on the side, which I thought was nice, and it was one of the better gyros I've had. He cautioned that everything was hot and asked if he could get me a water to go with my meal (I didn't order a drink). Again, how nice!\n\nIt was a quiet atmosphere when I was eating - they were slow for a Sunday night so I didn't get to see them interact with anyone else. I watched TV and just as soon as I was finished I saw the younger gentleman box up my pizza. He was going to bring this out to me too, but I beat him too the punch. He smiled warmly and thanked me again for my business. You could really sense their eagerness to do anything to make me happy. How refreshing.\n\nI had such a pleasant dinner here between working, it made the rest of my night go smoother. The gyro was really good, and my coworkers all were enthusiastic about the taste of the pizza (I tried it later - after it'd cooled and it still had good flavor - much better crust than I'd thought possible!).

The restaurant is very long with red walls.  It was quite empty when we got there.

For the drink, try the Sweetened Green Tea.  Not too sweet and compliments with the spicy seafood.\n\nThe special of the day was dungeness crab.  We didn't get it as it was $14.95/lb.  Instead we ordered 3 lbs of shrimp in a medium sauce, house special style and the catfish dinner.  We also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, some rice bowls, corn and bread.  I agree with Andy R.  OMG - the shrimp were huge from its head to its tail - as big as the distance between your thumb and your index finger!!  The shrimp were as thick as your thumbs!!!  They were indicated on the menu as Gulf Atlantic Shrimps.  I think they were just huge Tiger Prawns.  Make sure you order some rice and some bread to sop up the delicious sauce.  The sauce was unfortunately too little but we managed to sop up every little bit of sauce.  The sauce had roughly chopped up onions in it.   The rice was so fragrant; I think it's jasmine rice.  Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm!  We wanted more shrimp so we ordered another lb of shrimp, this time with spicy sauce.  The spicy sauce this time had a bit of kick in it and it tasted better.\n\nThe waiter was very helpful, pleasant and quick to serve.  \n\nWould we go back?  Sure, for that size of shrimp and the spicier sauce!\n\nTake advantage of the Grand Opening Special of 20% off entrees.

I may have missed it completely had it not been for the Groupon purchase.   It's a bar on the right, and a restaurant on the left.  The front of the building did not say Taste of Chi-town, but something like Town Center.   So look for the address and not the sign.  As we came in, it is a bit confusing with the bar and restaurant.  We probably looked lost.   We were quickly greeted by the owner, Mike, who looks like the Godfather and a Cook in one.   He was extremely friendly and was glad we decided to try the restaurant.   Mike said he was from Chicago and he missed the food and the people, and now with his restaurant he gets to see both.   We split a Joe's Spicy Italian Sandwich while we waiting for our pizza to be cooked.   Mike warned that the Chicago-style deep dish would take 35 minutes or so, but it was worth the wait.  The sandwich was incredible.   Very tasty and spicy.   I loved it.   Mike also gave us some complimentary fries which were delicious.   They had a mixture of lemon and feta.   Then the deep dish pizza came.  I could hear angles as the pizza was slowly placed on our table.   We decided to go with the sausage, green pepper, onion, and mushroom.   It was amazingly delicious.   The crust was crunchy and tasted much better than the usual crust.   Mike revealed that he uses corn meal for the crust and it definitely makes a difference.   It was equal or better than the pizza I had at Uno's in Chicago.    The sauce was amazing, the cheese tasted like fresh cheese and the ingredients also tasted crunchy and not frozen.   I would say Mike takes pride in his food and it shows.   I really enjoyed this place and would recommended it.   You do have to be patient because orders also come in from the bar area and the pizza takes a while to cook.   However, there are multiple televisions to entertain while you wait.   If you like Chicago food, you need to try this place.   It is a bit hard to find and a bit out of the way, but when you get there and eat that sandwich and/or the pizza, you will be glad you found it.   I will return.  Soon.

Nice pieces of fried eggplant and some very moist chicken for the other meal.We ordered a Chef Salad to split. The meats were rolled and cut as pinwheels. There was a lot of cold cuts rolled on this salad. Our salad was also mixed with black olive sliced, some pepperoncini, some red onion, nice tomato wedges, a hard boiled egg sliced in half, and a generous amount of lettuce that was torn in good sized pieces. They suggested their own italian dressing that I found flavorful but, a little acrid. The \"Boys\" split an order of spaghetti with meatballs (2). Great marinara and a couple very large dense and well cooked meatballs. The pasta was well cooked for my taste I'm not a fan of real la dente. The portion fed the two boys and made their eyes roll.

These were perfect, fresh made, puffed, and browned. It was a pure pleasure to put Tabbouleh, onion, tomato and my kafta into a half of a pita and savor the fine combination of flavors. All the meats were hot, juicy, and spiked with flavor.\n\nOur service here was quick, as quick as anything made fresh to order can be. The staff folks were friendly to the point that I really want to go there again just to feel so wanted and among the wonderful people.\n\nOur next trip here will be very soon. I intend to start with some Baba Ghanoug (ghanoush) (eggplant) and then on to more Tabbouleh, and probably Shawarma beef. Maybe I will get to some of the luscious looking Baklava.\n\nAll you \"round the world eaters\" don't miss this it is at the top of the list for Mediterranean cuisine or any other cuisine for that matter.", "business_id": "BzqwAx_KlRPAMGXw1xHXag", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-09-16", "useful": 3, "cool": 2}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "xWk0I0S9KWMB06wKUEDYxg", "review_id": "wiT9u9v40GOYGadCg_YKgg", "text": "Went to go here last night for dinner and they moved to 7750 S.

It's family owned and operated, they are ALWAYS pleasant..an added bonus for me is they already know what I'm getting when they see me walk in!  After you place your order, someone will bring out chips and salsa.  The verde sauce is the best!\n\nWen your food is ready, they bring it out to your table (of which there are 6-7 to choose from). \n\nThe only drawback is that they recently changed out their soda machine and switched over to offering canned soda and water, which I guess adds to the authenticity, but makes it unappealing (for ME) to order a soda.  \n\nSo about those nachos:  They make their own chips (of course), and they are a little thicker then a processed/storebrand tortilla chip.  This is good since they can withstand various wet ingredients and still BE A CHIP (not a pile of mush!)  Piled on top of these delicious chips is: carne asada meat (perfectly seasoned and tender), pinto beans (not in a sauce, just naked and happy to be eaten), mouthwatering pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole, and queso fresco (I believe).  There is too much for one person (unless you grossly overeat)-even when my fiance and I ate like fat people, we still barely finished it TOGETHER!! Also, the nachos are $6.30!!  So it's a great deal!\n\nSo check this place out if you're in the area..I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed!", "business_id": "lLj9ULb01sNIYDbYbeUqhA", "stars": 5, "date": "2011-09-02", "useful": 4, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "8SxkPsBBN9EbTRKShDUv1A", "review_id": "WYe9pPIligzlIHnRN82KeQ", "text": "Markato has moved to a new location on South Arville, across from the Orleans' hotel and Casino.

I've even had better sushi at a casino buffet. This place is only recommended to those people who enjoy fish that is not fresh, tasteless and surrounded by massive amounts of rice. First of all, there isn't the traditional glass sushi refrigerator that allows customers to observe the freshness of the fish (that was my first clue that I should have walked out immediately). The sushi refrigerator is probably missing because the fish isn't fresh at all. As far as I could tell the fish could even be pre-sliced. \n\nSecond of all, the AYCE sushi is only the cheap fish and it's only served as an inside-out roll. This reason is obvious, a traditional roll has the fish and rice on the inside. The seaweed sheet that wraps it being on the exterior limits the overall size. With an inside-out roll, the fish is in the middle; the seaweed wraps around the fish, and the rice wraps around the seaweed. As such, this allows the sushi chef to make the roll as big as possible (limited to the size where the mass of the rice overcomes the sticky or adhesive properties of the rice causing it to fall apart when lifted from the plate). In this sushi bar, that means the thickness of the rice is a very tightly packed 3/4 inch thick with a piece of fish about the width of the number 2 pencil. The over all width of a piece of sushi is at least 2 inches. It's impossible to eat a whole piece without breaking it up into several pieces. To use a chicken McNuggets analogy, each piece is like having three chicken McNuggets only the meat is only about the size of a dime with batter consisting of the rest. I deconstructed several pieces, and I ate the fish and rice separately; it was the only way to actually taste the fish. In all cases, the ratio of the volume of fish to rice was 1 to 8-10. \n\nThird of all, they do try to up sell you to buy nigiri sushi at a $1.00 to $3.00 per piece. I had a few of these. Again with the massive amount of rice, and stale tasteless fish. The chef didn't even know the proper technique for assembling a nigiri sushi, or maybe the proper technique doesn't work well when using insane amounts of rice. \n\nI can only imagine what a piece of gunkan-maki (battleship) style sushi would look like. It would probably be stuffed with rice to within a tenth of an inch from the top. Followed by a thin layer of the good stuff being spread out as thin as possible. Any gaps that would expose the rice is covered with mayonnaise (BTW, they don't use Japanese Mayonnaise, it tastes more like Miracle Whip).\n\nWhen you consider the base price for the lunch special, $9.99, and the up sell price, $1 to $3,  for nigiri style sushi, it quickly ends up costing the same or almost the same as a reputable establishment. I would recommend passing on this place and going to either Oyshi sushi or 808 sushi (must try Hamachi Kama, grilled yellowtail collar with ponzu sauce) if your on this part of town. You will have actually eaten real sushi and won't be left feeling like you were ripped off. I suspect that any positive review for this establishment will be from those who have a vested interest in its success or those who are very price sensitive. Those who honestly believe the sushi here is good, are newbies that need to get out more. They should try my recommendations above before engaging in any ad hominem responses.", "business_id": "VFVyecs0nMFA4xizXkzvKA", "stars": 1, "date": "2011-04-14", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "52EUpIzziGyOHjK1Ni3-Yw", "review_id": "U1Tx75FuUXbcMXP_mz-n6A", "text": "You can never go wrong here.

A ton of flavor, spicy enough (not \"Americanized\" because I'm 1/2 white). \n\nThe atmosphere is calm, quiet and private. The booths are accommodating for small groups, and the music is usually well chosen. \n\nThe things that need some improvement: the dog visiting behind the counter, although one reviewer referred to it as \"cute\" which I do not argue, it's unsanitary to have it walking around in the kitchen and hanging over dishes when the food is being handled (if I didn't love the place so much, I would honestly have to report it- but I've only seen the dog once). Service can sometimes be slacking if there are more than 3 tables, especially if those tables have Koreans at them. Not to say there is preferential treatment, but the servers tend to spend more time talking and checking in on the Korean speaking tables. \n\nOverall, I really do love this place and eat from their kitchen a couple times a month at minimum. Their beef soup is affordable and can last me for 3 meals, making it even more cost effective.

The freshly-made, gluten-free crust (on both the pizza and the bruschetta) tasted wholesome and authentic -- the way a bread crust should taste.  The tomato, onion, olive, bell pepper, and mushroom toppings tasted fresh and flavorful.  \n\nIn the interior of the restaurant are cafeteria-style booths and a bar with marble countertops.  Subdued lighting provides a nice ambiance.  Service was very friendly.

I rarely make changes to my order, so mine is usually good. \n\nSo we decided to give it another try- using a certificate from www.restaurant.com. We went with one of our friends. It was not too busy except for one large party. We had a bit of a wait on our meals.  They both ordered the seafood burrito but after a few bites noticed that the other seafood listed on the menu was missing. ( I don't remember what I ordered but I know that it was a safe choice for me.) They asked the waitress, and she checked in the back for us. She came back explaining that the cooks had run out of seafood- shrimp was the only seafood in the burritos. Why didn't the cook tell her in the beginning, so that she could've said something when the food was taken out to us? Also, the burritos were charged at full price even though they weren't as advertised.  The waitress only came back to refill our drinks once. We couldn't help but wonder if the service and the food was not at the best due to using a certificate from www.restaurant.com. \n\nEven with their posted signs with specials outside, we might not be back.

My husband wanted to try this place- he likes Asian buffets. It was $7.99 each- dropped from $9.99 for dinner (you don't pay first here, unlike Buffet @ Asia). The rating posted on the wall was an A rating, which is a good thing.\n\nThe food that I thought was pretty good: garlic shrimp (burped all night), coconut shrimp (surprisingly yummy), teriyaki chicken (good flavor), fried scallops (good), bbq chicken on sticks (good flavor), mushroom chicken (more mushrooms than chicken, but that's what I wanted anyway), california roll (fresh, the rice was not hard, as it usually is at buffets), cheese rangoon (hard to mess this one up though), fried fritter (not greasy and just enough sugar sprinkled). \n\nThe string beans tasted funny (you know how sometimes veggies can taste either metallic or like dirt). My husband said that he could of gotten more taste from the takeout container on the lo mein noodles- it was very bland. He also said that the won ton soup was the worst he ever had. \n\nThere is a mongolian station (but didn't see the raw veggies though, but then again, I didn't check out the other side either) and ice cream station are in the same general area (see what I mean about kind of a weird setup?)- (the mango was really good- almost tasted like Magnolia- A Filipino brand found in asian markets, the green tea had some ice particles). The other dessert available were lychee (mmm), bananas (some more bruised than others), pineapple, green jello (no hardened outer skin either), red jello, chocolate cocoa cake (really good actually), macaroons, and cream puffs. \n\nSome of the dessert food is right next to the salads; a little awkward of a setup, but suppose it works. Some of the dishes that I didn't sample include: shrimp (with heads), crawfish (not a fan), sliced sausage, sio mai, pork bun, noodles, fried rice, and the salads.\n\nThe \"Pinball Machine\" effect as I call it- many of the asian diners (85%-90% of the diners here- later saw a tour bus outside in the parking lot)- were actually running for the food as if it were going to disappear immediately (just watch out). Yes, just a warning, you will be bumped. You will get \"line-skipped\" as well. If there is a space, one will quickly be other there as well. Just letting you know what to expect. My husband couldn't wait to get over there when it was all clear. \n\nSticky floors are denoted with \"Caution Wet Floors\" signs all over near the food stations. Be careful if you are wearing boots or heels. I saw an employee mopping up the floors, which is nice that it is constantly being tended to BTW, but still be careful walking in those areas. The food stations are not messy but it seemed like some containers were completely out of food. I noticed a man kept going to the cooks asking for something. I also noticed that a man seated near us, asked for something, and it was brought over to his table, because it was the second time he asked (they didn't know what happened to it). \n\nThe decor inside is totally transformed from when it used to be a Black Angus steak house, with dark rich woods, dark lighting, semi-private booth seating, adding to the anonymity factor. Basically, in the main dining room, it is wide open and pretty bright (lighting). There is seating (two lanes, one being booth and the other tables & chairs, narrow) on the side of the food stations, as well, located near the bathrooms. This is where we were seated, but the employee was sweeping away all the food (how the heck food ended up on the floor, must mean slobby customers, and it was still kinda gross after the sweeping). The busy hostess asked us if that was ok. My husband wanted the booth.\n\nFinal verdict: my husband thought that Buffet @ Asia is better- I agree. I think it's a solid three stars though. I know what is good here, at least; I know what to avoid. Though the employees seem rushed, they are still pleasant and attentive (refills).", "business_id": "Y7JOip5LLaXc007OqkCg7g", "stars": 3, "date": "2011-01-10", "useful": 3, "cool": 1}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg", "review_id": "i_8JDNQAp9lF_I5SBDy_aA", "text": "It's back to basics for the original owners of Villa Pizza.

This place did just about everything it could think of to make me wish I never used an iphone app to find it. \n\nI went to Vegas this weekend to enjoy UFC 106 with some close friends. After Forrest Griffin made me happy I decided to top off the evening with something like The boiling Crab or the Crab hut. I used my friend's iPhone to find the nearest spot for us to indulge in some Cajun goodness. We got in a cab and hurried over to Cajun Crawfish. We arrived to find the place almost empty. We were sat and the waiter returned with our drinks. We ordered our usual and waited for about 15 minutes only to have the waiter return to our table to tell us they were out of corn on the cob....whaaaat?? ok ok ok...I can deal with that. But then we waited about another 30 minutes only to be confronted with the most flavorless crawfish and shrimp I have ever tasted in my life! Our potatoes come and they have no seasoning anywhere and are waaay undercooked. We sent the potatoes back to be cooked longer and they were still under cooked when the waiter brought them back. We ordered some steamed white rice and even that was horrible....how do you screw up rice? The sausage was undercooked, the crawfish was over cooked and lacked any flavor except spice. the shrimp was ok at best...a tad over cooked but still...ok. We tried to tell the female waitress about the potatoes and the rice only to find she doesn't speak English, so we were then stuck playing charades with the girl. After we were finished with our disaster of a dinner...we asked for wet naps. The lemon scented ones tend to cut the fishy smell out of your hands. Guess what?? No wet naps. \n\nWe agreed to call it quits for the evening and head back to the hotel. We asked the waiter to call a cab.....after asking every employee in the joint \"Do we have cab number?\" we decided to make use of the iphone once again and called our own cab. \n\nWe waited outside for our cab and noticed the sign for Cajun Crawfish stated \"Grand Opening\". Well, I don't know about \"grand\" but I guess the place is new. So here is my advice to the owners....shut down for a week and visit The Boiling Crab in LA area. Notice the flavor, the decor, the hospitable service, the flavor and the flavor or their food. Then come back to Vegas and regroup. There is no point in owning a below average establishment like this. When you have visitors that know what their food is supposed to taste like and visit your restaurant with certain expectations....they are just going to leave seriously unhappy and are going to tell all their friends about their piss poor experience. Not trying to be mean...but Cajun Crawfish is way under par. \n\nCajun Crawfish failed to deliver...in EVERY way possible. I will not go back and I will make sure that no one I care about makes the same mistake I did by going here. Waste of time, waste of money and there was a risk of food poisoning with the whole undercooked sausage thing. It's clear this place doesn't care about the quality of their food....looks like they are just happy enough to be open and have anyone walk through their doors. \n\n2 lb shrimp (1 mild and 1 medium) FAIL \n2 lb Crawfish (medium) FAIL \n12 practically raw potatoes FAIL \nno corn on the cob MAJOR FAIL \n24 undercooked sausage FAIL \n3 orders of slice bread GOOD \n2 order rice FAIL \n\nI would have been happier with Popeye's Chicken and Biscuits", "business_id": "Vm_xCBVn_Tu9P8an8N0vNQ", "stars": 1, "date": "2009-11-23", "useful": 6, "cool": 5}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "dMpjBsTaWTVRO0ST3-2B-A", "review_id": "CKvRltRfUzuM9gbz1Q9I4A", "text": "The lentil soup is DELICIOUS and so are the kabob plates (although not a fan of the garlic mayo dipping sauce that came w/ the kabob plate that I mistook for yogurt sauce).

The place is very open, bright and clean. The girl at the counter was really helpful as I hadn't been before so I asked for a recommendation. You can always tell if the employees like the food because when you ask what they like best, there's a hesitation. Without any hesitation she said, \"Breaded steak or chicken sandwich.\" I decided to go with the Italian beef because 1) I've had good Italian beef and 2) I love Italian beef. The wait wasn't long and when I got the bag with my sandwich in it, it was like a pile of bricks. I was salivating all the way home. I'm not sure if it was meant to be dipped or it was just the delicious juices dripping from the sandwich and soaking into the roll, but yowza did it look and smell delicious when I unwrapped it. Biting in was about what I anticipated, it was tender and juicy and everything meat should be. The only complaint, and I use the word loosely because it could easily be an artistic decision, is that the giardiniera veggies were in huge pieces. I like a really small cut giardiniera so that it blends like a proper accoutrement. However, I'm not from Chicago, maybe that's how some people do it there. Other than that the sandwich was fantastic and far too big to eat in one meal. That's most of the reason I haven't been back, I know I need to go on a free day when I'm really hungry.

After cooking the meat quickly for about 15 second, then you wrap it up in rice paper with plenty of mints and rice noodle, dipped in the pineapple fish sauce, i was instantly transport back to Vietnam! \n\nOver all, very very very good place to go eat, they also have good desserts too, try the tri-colors coconut tapioca drink, ask for extra green bean mash, you won't be disappointed!  \n\nP.S. if you want to come and eat the BBQ set, should come after lunch or dinner rush, that way you can relax and enjoy your food, or come with a bunch of people for a fun, hand on experience!", "business_id": "sBQA33hT0VGJHh0a5ERkPA", "stars": 5, "date": "2013-01-29", "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "5m-p2ddJBi4nIXWSglVGEQ", "review_id": "GflL6cniktQm9tSTXqM1Uw", "text": "Not too shabby.

I would definitely recommend sharing because they are big portions..Only thing I didn't like was the crappy bowl that it came in...It was too flimsy and hard to eat...Definitely a great spot to come to cure hangovers if you are staying at the Rio..", "business_id": "eHgxuooEDnjsmmckxPcKHQ", "stars": 4, "date": "2011-06-21", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "40m0541Z_KexYkdvvqHJIQ", "review_id": "f3DuC7exUk7ZsJcjPpLW9Q", "text": "Due Pizzeria is by far the best pizza pies in Las vegas and is up there with the best in the country.

They do it right.  \nI will get a hot dog next time and they have a greek menu that makes me excited to try the gyros.  \nHighly recommend this place to my fellow chicagoans here in vegas.", "business_id": "wlY7T5ue3lL8Hcf1r_Ts2A", "stars": 5, "date": "2012-01-16", "useful": 1, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g", "review_id": "is9_Mfyq1s5uPKpMbwmHLQ", "text": "This is just an awesome little \"hole in the wall\" Mexican restaurant. Their prices are great and their food has that home made taste that many places struggle to capture, but El Cordobes does it with ease.\n\nIf I had to describe this place in one word it would be \"authentic\". Their menu isn't tailored towards Americanized Mexican food like so many other places do. You won't find a salsa bar or queso dip, but you will find tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and things like goat soup.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you'll notice the dining area is very small, just a few booths and some tables in the middle. I wouldn't come here as a large group, as I don't think they would have the staff to handle it even if they had the room. This seems like a place that always has just one cook and one server.\n\nI love the salsa here, though be warned it is a little spicy and they don't have anything milder (like I said, authentic). Funny enough this is they only thing I have had that seem's spicy, though everything is well seasoned. One thing that stand's out about their food is they seem to use less salt than any other Mexican Restaurant I have been to. You don't really notice how salty most Mexican food is until you come to a place like this that doesn't use as much. The lack of salt is actually a good thing, as it let's the natural flavors of the ingredients and seasoning's stand on their own. And heck, you can always add a little salt if you need it (though I have never felt the need here).\n\nI've tried quite a few things on the menu, and I have been impressed with almost everything. I am even more impressed considering their prices are excellent. Almost all their meals are less than $10, and burritos run for $6 or less. The two thing's that just astound me are that they have ceviche tostadas for $1.50 and tacos for $1.25. You can't find prices like that at Mexican fast food, let alone a sit down environment! And they have a ton of meat options for the tacos to; chorizo, asada, pastor, carnitas and chicken just to name a few. My wife and I almost always get a few tacos in addition to our meals every time we come here as they are very good and you just can't beat that price.\n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is anything with shredded beef in it, though I also love their chili verde. To be honest the only thing I ever had here that I didn't like is a torta with breaded steak, and even then the flavor was good it was just really chewy and tough. I also see a lot of people order soups, which I haven't tried myself but smell great and are served in large bowls. The next time we come here I plan on trying one.\n\nOne last thing, they have Mexican sodas and Mexican beers for great prices to. Sodas are $2 and beers are $3. Everything is served in glass bottles, and the coke is even in the larger size than the typical 12 ounce size. Yet another thing that adds to the authenticity of this establishment.\n\nIf you love really good authentic Mexican food, then you really need to give El Cordobes a try. This is one of those places that really stands above most of the rest.", "business_id": "ifkCEpYaSAUT3WVQNxwvXA", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-07-27", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "MiLQJdU2yUuC1Nm54PJioA", "review_id": "mpo0SwhsacaQZDAeGyHDNg", "text": "This place is amazing!

Specifically, I have had the Raiders Roll and the Miss Monica Roll, which were both phenomenal. As well as garlic tuna and yellowtail nigiri which both melted in my mouth, it was so good! \n\nSushi chef and owner Nico does a great job interacting with his customers and delivering quality fresh fish that he personally picks up and checks out everyday. His attention to detail and the amount of flavor he has in each of his roles is insane! You can tell he is all about quality control and only serves the best. \n\nAlso, don't let the yelp reviews fool you. The first week we went in this place was slammed, and everyone appeared happy and satisfied. There's something up with yelp because a couple of months ago this place had 4.5 deserved stars and I checked back recently to see they have removed majority of those for some reason. So what's up with that yelp?! \n\nRegardless, I hope future customers come to enjoy the deliciousness that is Sushi Wabi! Recently, our other go-to sushi bar Kabuki in Tivoli Village closed but we are happy to have Wabi to fill the void.

One was the gyro plate and the other the vegetarian pita sandwich. Each came out about five minutes after I ordered in separate containers. A side of plain rice came with each sandwich and some type of vinegar dressing and the gyro with a yogurt dressing. I picked the vegetarian for my friend and I had the gyro. \n\nWell, let's say that the gyro was pretty flavorless. Oh, except for the thousands of huge chunks of onions. I ended up pulling out half the thickness of the pita with just raw onions. Total overkill. As for the meat, it was not the fresh meat I was expecting. Kind of dry and very little inside the sandwich. I believe there was a couple tomatoes and perhaps some lettuce. The rice was also flavorless and bland. There was a little pile of lettuce and tomato and more onion for a 'salad' that I didn't quite understand since I thought that some of my sandwich had fallen out but evidently that was a salad. \n\nMy friend wasn't thrilled with his sandwich either. It had feta cheese, avocado and tomato. His reply when I asked how it was ... \"It's okay... too expensive for this though.\"\n\nOverall The Mad Greek Cafe is overpriced for what you are getting.

There has been serious vote stuffing here. Or food deprived reviewers. \n\nSo I read the Yelp reviews and 4 and a half stars...I drive there on a Monday...duh, closed. So, we go back tonight- Tuesday.

But, folks this isn't the place. The waitress took 10 minutes to get to us, another 10 to bring the miso soup, after I asked again. Then, we had the entree come but, the sushi was missing. When it came after I asked for it, the salmon (sake) and unagi sushi tasted like it came out of a freezer. The decor is just sad. The chairs in the waiting area are all seriously stained. The bathrooms are dirty. Small things like this are clues to the experience you're about to have if you look for them.

Where to start with this place?  My girlfriends and I went in and the place was empty.  The service was a bit slow but the guy behind the bar, Jazz, chatted with us after we pulled conversation out of him.  I mentioned we were locals.  He seemed uninterested.   \n\nWe fell in love with the decor and all the fun items in the room.   I loved the fact that we had the spot to ourselves & the decor,  so I called my husband and his business partner to join us.  They met up with us and we tried the pizza.  \n\nWe had one that had chorizo and were blown away  by the flavor so we ordered another pizza.  As we were waiting on the food a camera crew showed up.  After a time of them setting up equipment they asked us if we would be willing to be on camera for Bar Rescue.  We agreed.  Thank goodness we were there or they wouldn't have had anyone to show on the shoot.\n\nA guy with blue hair showed up and was hanging behind the bar.  He was rude and leaning on the bar, watching what the crew was doing.  I asked him if he should clean up or mess of empty plates, dishes and napkins, and he said no he wasn't on the clock.  He laughed and moved to be closer in the background of the camera shot.  I got his attention again and said, \"Don't you take pride in your work?  The empty glasses and trash are in the shot.  Show me where the trash can is and I will clear it up.\"  After some reluctance he helped me clean up the mess.\n\nMy husband struck up a conversation with Jazz and found out he was one of the owners.  Later we found out that a guy who was watching us from the corner was the other owner.  When we left we said we would be back for the pizza.\n\nTwo weeks later my husband and I came in. Jazz was working and had no recollection of us.  How do you forget 5 locals who spent hours at your bar and eventually a camera crew making your place look good?  He didn't remember us so he barely talked with us, instead it was a Friday night and there was a group that came in that seemed to take his attention.  We got our pizza but refills on drinks came so slow that we were tired of waiting and decided to leave. \n\nOnce outside there was the group that had come in and Jazz.  A girl called out, \"Why are you leaving?  Stay the dancing is abut to go off.\"  We politely declined but were shocked at how again the place had such slow service and the owner seemed to be more interested in hanging out than making sure customers were happy.\n\nWe are gluttons for punishment I guess, because we had some friends in town and took them here for pizza.  They had seen the Bar Rescue show and wanted to try it.  We walked in and there were 6 people at the bar.  (6 on a Friday night happy hour time.)\n\nWe found a table and I walked up to the bar to order food and drinks.  Jazz was working again.  He was the only one behind the bar.  I ordered drinks and my friend got his food order out.  Jazz then turned his back to us and started making his way around the bar again.  Checking on people and chatting with them.  He came back after checking the bar for drinks.  He gave us our drinks and I said excuse me.  But some new people came in and sat at the bar and he was gone again.  My husband was on the phone and called out, \"Get me a Diet Coke please.\" I said loudly in Jazz's direction, \"I'm trying but he hasn't gotten my order yet.\"\n\nAfter a while he came back and said, \"Did you need something.\" I explained he hadn't gotten my drink and food order, only my friend's order had been completed.  He said, \"Okay well what do you want?\"  I ordered the chorizo pizza again to which he said, \"Oh I care about the safety of my customers.  There was an issue with food poisoning at Firefly.  Did you hear about that.\"  I nodded dumbfounded.\n\n\"Ever since that has happened I quit.  I have substituted it with sausage.  You will like it.\"  He said.  I wanted to call BS because the Firefly incident had happened in May or late April.  I had been to this spot twice in less than a month and they had it, but at this point why argue.  I was just happy to have my order taken.  I rolled my eyes a bit and noticed a zombie arm was gone on the wall from the decor.    Where it had been was a grey patch and holes where the nails had once been.  (Mind you this is a black background.)  How hard is it to get a ladder, slap some black paint on a spot, and make the focal point of your bar look somewhat okay?\n\nWe got our food but as before our drinks were empty.  When we asked the lady that delivered our food about our drinks she said, \"I think Jazz is working on that,\" and disappeared back in the kitchen.  My husband tried to get drinks.  Jazz said he was busy and we would have to wait, as he had the hose in his hand. (We ordered waters and diet cokes.)

Despite the fact that I give this 3 stars, I am forever grateful we took the effort to find it. It's downstairs in the back near the valet entrance and nail salon or something like that. 4 of us ate at the teppan grill and had a roll or two. Rolls were good, not great. We were the only people in the entire place. It was a bit... odd. The decor is ok, but I felt like we were eating in a basement (I guess because we were.) Anyway, the food WAS extraordinary. Our chef, was head chef Tsutomu Molde. He was incredibly personable and very skilled at the teppan. The food WAS some of the best I had ever had at a teppan. Here's the deal though: Tsutomu has since left and opened his own restaurant (Musashi) just off the strip. All his skill, talent and personality are now gone from Hamada. We visit Musashi regularly now. He made the sauces from his own recipes and cooked like a master. Would I ever revisit this location? NO. I would go elsewhere. I cannot believe they are even open still, after he left. It's like a bar losing it's liquor license.

At the window the woman was very nice and friendly but the way she was talking to me made me feel like I was a little special (slow.)

The burger was juicy and tasty, the cheese was your standard american and the toppings were there.

Also, after my order was taken it took about 11 minutes for me to receive my food (with no other visible customers). I don't mind waiting this long for fresh food so this was okay.
