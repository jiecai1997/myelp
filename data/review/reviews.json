I asked for one, but there lady putting the stuff in my cart looked at me and said \"we're out sweetie\", as I'm staring at a cart full one lane over to her. So I walked over and grabbed box, so she could put the stuff in it (it was raining outside and did not feel like putting stuff in the box on my own with the rain. So, I start talking to the cashier, pay and turn around to see the damn box set ON TOP of my cart.... EMPTY! I'm in awe! Why are people at work NOT working?",

  "text": "I have been here three times and the food here is awesome!  I didn't even know about this restaurant until my mom asked us to go with her.  The first time I went I ordered camarones al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp) which was delish.  During yesterday's visit I ordered 1 chile relleno burrito, 1 tongue taco, 1 adobada taco.  I asked for rice to be added to the burrito, and this was done :). The burrito was great with a lot of cheese.  The tacos had so much flavor.  The day before I tried the tacos from Taco Tijuana but the tacos at\nEl cordobes are better that Taco Tijuana.  \nTaco Ranking so far FYI\n#1 spot- Las Taquizas on Lamb and Bonanza. \n#2 spot- El Cordobes\n#3 spot- Taco Tijuana\nYou can read my reviews for all.  \nEl cordobes has very good prices for their food.  Everything I had was 1 burrito, 2 tacos and 1 soda all for $10.50.  When I walk into this place it feels as if I were walking into my grandmas home to eat her food.  The only problem here is that they do not have flavored water like horchata, tamarindo and Jamaica.  All they have are sodas and beers, but the food is soo good that it makes up for this.  Please make sure you get the refried beans with your food!!  Also, I think it's cash only.  I payed cash but I think I saw a sign that said no debit/credit.",

  "text": "As soon as you walk in the place is very hot.  No customer, we were the only one.  . They have fans on which help.  The place looks nice.     They must have the temperature at 85 degrees.  We  were greeted by what looks like the owner. He did not say hello just said \" how many \" with a frown on his face.  Looks like he just lost his paycheck at the casino.  When I ordered the chicken noodle soup \" mien ga\" he said \"No eggs ok?\" While pointing to the picture of the egg on the menu.  When my father ordered the Vietnamese pancake appetizer he just said \"NO \" in a very stern voice.  I don't think he was being rude to us but it's the personality of a thug or someone who may have grew up in a bad place.   While we waited ,The owner and his friend was chatting at one of the tables. I heard some profanity \" mother fxxker\" in Vietnamese.  Not too professional.  \n\n\nWhen we got the food it was average. Every time the owner brought us something like water, menus , food, I said the thank you.  He didn't reply.  \n\n\nOverall I can not recommend this place.  Average food , poor customer service, uncomfortably hot environment.",

This place is a nice mom and pop establishment with friendly and respectful service. The pho didn't taste bad and was a good portion, it was a little on the fatty side. I typically add a little more fat to my pho, but I didn't have to with this broth. Take that as you will, some people like it lean some don't. \n\nBe sure to check out the signs on the wall since they have other dishes that may not be in the menu. This place seems to be starting out and growing, hopefully they do well! Check them out.",

  "text": "Yessssss!!!! I'm so happy to FINALLY have a Skinny Fats on this side of town! Skinny Fats is located at the old Ribs n Burger location in Downtown Summerlin and they have a great patio area. Downtown Summerlin is also bringing in Makers and Finders, so happy to see them supporting local businesses instead of the giant chain restaurants.\n\nI popped in to Skinny Fats on a Saturday morning right after they opened and ordered a couple breakfast dishes as well as the Caulifire (because I CANNOT come to Skinny Fats and not order the Caulifire).\n\nIf you haven't been to Skinny Fats, the idea is that half the menu is Indulgent and the other half is Healthy (though still delicious). It's a great low-key date place because you can order one entree from each side and share, and not feel too guilty. \n\n...My only issue (and it's kind of a big one) is that if you're a low-carb eater or eat a keto / ketogenic diet, there are very few options. Both sides of the menu are pretty carb heavy. Granted, they will customize. (We ordered the Smotherload burrito minus the potatoes and minus the tortilla as well as the Wake n Bacon minus the bun and they were happy to oblige.)  Buuuuut....it would be nice if they had a couple more non-carby options. I will definitely be trying that Zucchini bowl though!",

  "text": "Ok so... I wasn't expecting the best deli I've ever been to coming in.   I usually notice that the larger a chain gets the less the quality of the food is important.  Also, this location hasn't been open for very long so there are going to be a few kinks no matter what. \n\nUpon walking in we had no idea what to do.   Someone at the meat counter was very friendly and asked if we wanted a sample of anything which is very nice but we were lost.   There were quite a large amount of employees but they all seemed to be being trained. \n\nWe went to a register that was closed but the girl standing there didn't acknowledge us or point us in the right direction.  Finally I asked what looked like the manager and she told us there was only one register. \n\nThe cashier at this register was training 2 others and he was very nice and friendly.   \n\nThe food we ordered was actually better than I expected!  The corned beef was delicious and I've never had pickled green tomatoes and I thought they were great.  The potato knish had a great flavor but the outside was super tough.   Like I could hardly rip it tough.   If I ate gluten  (the knish totally has gluten and I had hives for it but it was that good inside) I totally would have ordered a bagel because they looked pretty delicious. \n\nOverall I think this place succumbs to typical Vegas Strip chain eating.   Very expensive but pretty mediocre.",

It came with freshly made hummus.\n\nFrench fries pro tip: Dip the french fries in garlic sauce AND the fry sauce.\n\nThe frozen Greek yogurt was a refreshing, cold treat. Made in house.\n\nOverall, definitely recommend and will be back again.",

  "text": "The restaurant was formally known as the Empress Court. Extremely overpriced and the food's taste was decent but definitely didn't match up with its price. We came for a family dinner and ordered a black cod steamed in soy sauce. The waiter did not inform us on the market price until we saw the bill which cost $268 for a 3lbs black cod alone. The market price in the supermarket was $5.99/lbs so i wonder which market did they got the fish? Our bill was actually over a thousand bucks for 5 roasted pigeons, 2 black cods, two Yang Chow fried rice, 8 prawns, and one kungpao chicken. All of this would cost us about $300 at New Port Seafood restaurant in Alhambra or 888 Seafood restaurant in San Gabriel and their foods taste better too.",

After waiting a while we noticed a few people that ordered food after us received there food. My boyfriend went up to the cashier to ask when our food was going to be ready. One of the guys making sandwiches snapped at him saying it takes 15-20 minutes. He came back to the table and We looked at the receipt for the time and it had been 17 minutes. I noticed the two guys pointing a us and giving us dirty looks. I figured we give them a little more time and give them benifit. after watching a few more people get there order I walked up there to find out what was going on since it had been almost a half hour. The cashier apologized again and again saying our order was lost to give them 5 more minutes. We told him we were tired of waiting it shouldn't take 30 minutes to make a sandwich we just wanted our money back. He understood and kept apologizing while refunding our money. He was super nice and felt horrible. The other two, not so much instead of trying to get our order ready they stood there giving us dirty looks. Very disappointed in this place and will never go back.",

  "text": "Being that this place is inside the RIO, I'd say that they have a pretty captive audience - especially late at night. That being said, its still a decent little spot to eat at if you are staying here. I ended up staying at the Rio on some comped nights for the new years so I found myself here in need of some food to soak up the alcohol in the system late at night. Had tried a few different things from this place. The braised oxtail was good - but not nearly as good as the oxtail soup from the California casino in downtown - anyone who has eaten that late night, knows what I am talking about. One of the best anywhere. The Yang chow fried rice is really good and if you have some other dishes with rice already... getting the bbq pork without rice is a great option - its like twice as much to get it with rice! \n\nThe only consideration is that if you are mobile and have a car... you are right near a huge Chinese food area on spring mountain road where you can get more bang for your buck. Then again... when you are in a casino, you already know that you are going to pay a little more and hopefully you have gambled enough to get some free food comps. \n\nDon't look for anything too fancy here... It's really like a cafeteria where you order and pick up your food and go sit down at an empty table to eat afterward.",

  "text": "This just might be the best food truck to ever debut on the streets of Las Vegas.\n\nBoqueria Street is a new food truck that, per their web site, just launched in January of this year. I'd be one of the first to say that you're usually not going to find anything truly special on wheels, with a few notable exceptions of course, so I'm not that I'd never heard of them until i saw the lineup of a new weekly food truck event that I was planning to visit. After trying the food, I became very surprised indeed.\n\nThe highlight of their menu of \"Barcelona Inspired Street Food\" (you'll see the words on both sides of the truck) is actually a separate blackboard full of Iberico ham options (Jamon Iberico \"de Bellota\" to boot, which is reputedly the highest qualtiy). The gentleman outside the truck pointed out this menu while I stared pensively at the truck, and the chef went so far as to offer me a sample.\n\nI will admit that I have certainly never had Iberico before, so I have no point of comparison, but the morsel of meat that the chef offered me was the best thinly sliced ham that I have ever had the pleasure to taste - far richer than whatever prosciuttos that I've eaten (laugh at me all you want, but I'm not that well-traveled or experienced). Consequently, I had to order off their Iberico menu, whether or not the pig that this came from actually ingested acorns and only acorns all of its life.\n\nI chose the Flat Bread of Iberico ($12), which was simply the ham draped on a flatbread, with some tomato and olive oil in between. I already waxed poetic about the ham, but the bread was surprisingly good, certainly far better than whatever run-of-the-mill pitas that every Greek place uses. The tomato was a welcome acidic accent, but perhaps slightly overpowering in some bites. Still, I'd definitely suggest ponying up for either this or really any of their other options if they offer what they call Iberico.\n\nI was also hungry enough to order the Barcelona Sausage ($8.50), a non-encased pork sausage in a buttery roll with zucchini sprouts and chimichurri mojo verde. I really have to highlight the awesome roll, which is by far the best bread that I've had from a food truck and certainly one of the better ones if I include brick-and-mortar. They actually source it from local outfit Great Buns Bakery, but whether it's the third-party softness and airiness or the chef's grill treatment, you can't miss their bocatas (aka bocadillos, aka sandwiches) for this reason alone.\n\nThe sausage needed to shine too - heck, it's the namesake - and it indeed had a rich, meaty flavor. It kinda reminded me a bit of bratwurst, actually. The accompaniments are also nice, including some chips (taro?) that were somewhat prone to falling off but still delivered a touch of crunchiness. I'll likely also grab another bocata next time to see what else they have to offer.\n\nBy the way, both portion sizes are what I'd charmingly call \"modest.\" But with food trucks, you're often prone to paying prices not too much lower for food that's certainly inferior. Same for brick-and-mortar places, sometimes. Go for quality over quantity here and then pig out on whatever gut bombs you might find at other trucks at events.\n\nAs food trucks often do, Boqueria Street posts their menu on their various social media pages, as well as their web site (which also has a copy of the menu, sin* Iberico). That's how you'll find them, and you definitely should make the effort to try one of the best food trucks in town and one of the more interesting new food ventures, four-wheeled and four-walled alike.\n\n[*because not everyone learns at least sufficient Spanish to get by, sin = sans = without - capisce?]",

I guess it's needless to say, the meat was flavorless as well. The adobada was hard, greasy, and hacked into tiny, tasteless granules of meat. The rice was dry. The beans were so dry, you had to scrape the top off to get the bottom bland portion.\n\nThere used to be two men behind the counter (one very handsome : )) that did an exceptional job with the food.

The food is always fabulous and the drinks are super cold. The locals that hang out there are also very friendly and it reminds me of the show cheers where everybody knows your name (or at least remembers your face and says hi and will hold a great conversation!) I have been going to this bar for a few years now and miss a couple of faces that got kicked out due to talking loudly when the owner came in one night! (I don't agree with that part!) I do like to bring my people here and show off my nice clean bar w/ the best bartenders ever! Thanks ladies, Martin and Rich for always making that rough day a little better!",

The gentleman (I believe he is a partner in the business) was also super nice.\nTo the food,I had mine with the onion marmalade on the side, my wife had hers just the way they make it. We both LOVED this sandwich. The tri-tip was cooked perfectly. The baguette was perfect for this sandwich. The garlic sauce was superb as well. They knocked this sandwich out of the park. Fries and fry sauce we're excellent as well. \n\nI already texted some friends that work at UNLV to let them know they have a new restaurant that needs to be added to their rotation. I will be letting my bar customers know as well. I always pull for a unique, family run place and I know I found a winner.",

  "text": "The Goodwich might finally have a challenger for the local sandwich crown.\n\nKarved is a new fast-casual restaurant focused on rotisserie meats and, thus far, a simple menu with sandwiches, plates, sides, and some other items. They're sandwiched (appropriately) between TIABI and Sakana in a fairly small strip mall on Maryland Parkway. \n\nMy eyes lit up when I first saw porchetta on the menu photo. It's not a common if at all available pork preparation in this town (or at least as far as Yelp reviews have cataloged it). After I checked with a friend and received confirmation that it's awesome, I beelined there for lunch, finding the place fortunately (for me) not very busy.\n\nAfter seeing the rotisserie at work right behind the counter, with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes both filling drip trays below the porchetta, I decided that I should go pick one of those as a side. Fearing a potential food coma, I kept it light by picking the Brussels sprouts ($4), which appropriately came out at the same time as the sandwich. I wouldn't outright call them mushy, but they're on the soft side and had no crunch. Also, the portion on this was a bit modest for the price. At least the Brussels sprouts are subtly tasty, likely owing to the porchetta drippings.\n\nThe owner was offering sample cups of Cilantro Chicken Soup ($5) while people waited for their orders. After tasting it, I almost had to order one to-go. It's balanced in seasoning and thickness, and the chicken was so tender that you don't even have to hear the owner say that the soup is made fresh daily. Plus, the bowl is quite generously sized.\n\nI did bury the lede a bit, and that's the brilliant Porchetta Sandwich ($12). I was worried that the \"French baguette\" bread would be tough if not outright sharp, but it was simply a delicious and chewy container for the goodness within. That treasure starts with awesome porchetta, including juicy pork loin and the crispy skin of the belly, the latter an unparalleled textural experience. The lemon sauce (with herbs) complements everything perfectly, and the fresh arugula completes the Italian-inspired experience. It doesn't get too messy compared to some sandwiches.\n\nThe porchetta alone earns Karved a top rating in my book, and the chicken soup was memorable enough for me to overlook the Brussels sprouts. Hopefully, I'll be free to come back soon to try some of their other options, including that yet-to-be-explored tri-tip.",

We have been in Vegas for 32 years, and you just can't find service like this anymore.  That is why you will only find us there on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.  Stephanie and Jim run a bar that is both classy and blue collar at the same time. The decor is dark wood and timeless elegance, but the vibe is everyday fun.  The Rancho/Craig location is our favorite neighborhood bar, but the Five Star at the location of the previous Cooler Lounge (for you native Vegans) is another favorite of ours. There you will find Omar...the finest cook of Cuban cuisine this side of...well...CUBA ! !\n\nFor a good time, visit Anita at Rancho and Craig.  All you bikers out there will find it next to your favorite leathers store, facing Craig.\n\nFive Star is the best Vegas has to offer, and it is our daytime bet for good food and good gaming odds.\n\nBarbara and Ed Andrews",

The lunch portion was a perfect portion for me. we get a salad and an egg roll. usually the portion is too much but I ate everything and didn't feel that food coma!\n\nI also had a Thai tea. I believe 3 bucks for a Thai tea is a bit steep but I enjoyed it still. I'll give it another try and actually dine in next time.\n\nDon't forget your stamp cards! every time you spend at least $20 they'll give you a stamp.",

This place offers breakfast dishes like huevos a la mexicana, huevos rancheros, chilaquiles and more.  For lunch there is tacos, burritos, tostadas, taquitos, flautas, tamales, beef soup, pozole, menudo, seafood soup, ceviche, carne asada, goat stew(birria) and it goes on.  Mexican soda pop, beer, coffee, and other drinks.  This place takes cash only, and it is very inexpensive.  So splurge!",

  "text": "Decided to give this place a try since I was craving pad thai. Went right at 11AM and ordered the lunch special shrimp pad thai and a side of sticky rice to go. They asked the level of spice from 1-10 and I said 3.\nOnly waited about 12 minutes and it was ready.  Presentation was nice and looked really good. Sticky rice was exactly that, sticky rice. I've had better but it wasn't horrible. The salad was small but tasty. The egg roll was crispy and I really enjoyed the glass noodles inside. It was a pleasant surprise. The pad Thai had 5 large shrimp which isn't bad for a lunch size portion. The flavor profile didn't quite have enough of the peanut flavor in my opinion but was satisfying. However, I would think that a level 3 out of 10, my lips and mouth should not be burning afterward and they are. Overall a fairly neutral experience. I have had better and it was a little higher priced than I would have liked, but it was definitely better than the peanut butter jelly sandwich I was contemplating eating.",

Churros are yummy, pizza is bomb, chicken bakes are good, and the Polish dog combo can't be beat. The ice is like the small chunky ice but bigger so it's log like ice? I like it. Pepsi products for beverages too. All IN all, It's great to eat for your before Costco fuel up OR the after burner.... that is if you don't get too full from the samples around the store",

  "text": "Chef Oscar's Vaca Saltada bocata was love at first bite: succulent braised beef topped with gooey manchego, brightened up with red onion and spicy yellow chili-mayo. The tender, juicy meat is comforting and delicious, well-balanced with the other ingredients, packed into a sturdy fresh-baked roll. Praise calling this \"the best food truck ever\" are not overstated. Boqueria Street is the real deal, bringing Spanish street food to the food truck followers of Las Vegas. They are well worth hunting down, driving out of your way, and rearranging your schedule. The food lives up to the hype and then some!\n\nOther standout menu items include the classic Jamon Serrano bocata with ham, mozzarella, and truffle mushrooms. The patatas bravas always make a great side with a zesty sauce and green onions, and are a generous portion for the $5 price tag. The croquetas are not always available, so get them if you see them- they're as tasty as the version served in a shoe on the Strip, at a fraction of the price.\n\nTruly a menu with something for everyone. If you don't do pork products, there's the Pollo (chicken) bocata. There's a veggie roll that can be vegan-ized. Even pescatarians have the Gambas shrimp appetizer. And those are just the regular menu items! Each time I've found the BS truck, they have several featured special items, too. \n\nThough they may \"just\" be a food truck, the attention to detail and quality of product they put out is easily comparable to what is available at brick and mortar options. The exterior is pristine, with ambiance added by bistro tables topped with small plants for a dining area. Chef Oscar and his assistant are always armed with a smile and, if you ask nicely, a sample of jamon iberico!",

Everyone was so personable and customer-experience oriented.\n\nOn to the food.  Their twist on porchetta, rotisserie style, makes for a fabulous and savory filling in a large ciabatta roll. The amber cracklings added some snap to the generous sandwich, topped with peppery arugula tossed in seasoned olive oil. Listen up pork afficionados, Hawaiians and Filipino compatriots--if you love porchetta, lechon and roast pig, you will love this sandwich!  If your dream sandwich includes beef instead, prepare to be happy with their tender tri-tip. My hubby was made very happy with his choice. Let it be noted that he had to take home the remaining half of his sandwich because #1, we were given samples of their delicious spicy beef broth soup and chicken cilantro rice soup; and #2, we gorged ourselves on their hummazing hummus and hot fried pita triangles, in addition to herb seasoned french fries plus fry sauce (yay, a noteworthy resemblance to yummy Utah Greek diner fry sauces).\n\nThe owner, I believe (Minnesota man who also loves hockey) let us try their frozen, fresh yogurt made today by his wife.  Creamy, tangy and lemony flavored goodness, topped with crushed honey-soaked baklava.  WOW, I would stop in here just for that!  Who am I kidding? I would stop in here for nearly anything on their menu.  The only thing I would change is to move them closer to where we live!",

After about a year of waiting, we practically gave up on this. Needless to say, we were thrilled when it opened seemingly out of nowhere. \n\nWe made plans to have a group lunch the Wednesday after opening. After a crazy morning, those plans changed to placing a group to-go order, which one of our team members graciously took on. \n\nUnfortunately, despite having a very clear list of everyone's choices, our team member came back to the office over an hour after leaving to find that several of the orders were wrong. \n\n- a diet soda was missing \n- crispy chicken sandwiches were replaced by grilled chicken sandwiches\n- reuben sandwiches were replaced by just pastrami or corned beef \n- a salad that was ordered was not placed in the bag \n- a few other things I can't remember since I didn't run the order\n\nIn addition, the dessert menu was not yet fully up and running. Our team member ordered what she could based on what was available. However, we were disappointed to find that a number of dessert choices were outsourced from Freed's.\n\nOther than the service/flow issues, the food was great. Latkes were crisp and delicious. Pastrami and corned beef were juicy and tender. Bread was fresh. Matzoh ball soup was savory and deep. I'm hopeful that the kinks will be worked out and we'll have a reliable pastrami/deli option for lunch soon.",

We placed our order and received our noms in about 20mins.\n\nMy grub:  how does one rate Turkey meatballs in pesto and arrabiato sauce?? I found them delicious, but yeah...i can recreate this at home perhaps. Ditto for the cauliflower rice. Not dazzling. It's a damn veggie. BUT...again...i ordered as calorie conscious and macro efficient as possible. All in all, tasty enough and would def order again when hangry for a light meal.\n\nHub's grub:  I mean....he inhaled it.  By the sounds escaping his lips and gastrointestinal tract, you could clearly tell he loved it. He kept affirming this by repeating..\"...wow...sooooo good.  Damn.  These patties are juicy!  Bread is toasted just right!  Perfect amount of cheese! Omg!!! Best. Truffle. Fries. EVERRRRR\".  So yeah. Guess he enjoyed his noms.\n\nWe (especially me) will definitely be back.

So those who are Paleo and keto, they have options but they don't promote them. Goes against the name! \n\nMy daughter got the spicy chicken salad & frankly I can't remember what her boyfriend got. Something with fries. Err, the salt and pepper shakers were cute. \n\nGreat atmosphere and location for those shopping in the area. I think this is one of those places that has focused on interior more than food. Only time will tell if they up their game. Perhaps they can't showcase quality ingredients with higher rent...",

  "text": "Not really into sandwich places but I was in Santa Fe Station and hungry so I followed a friend's advice and tried it. Out of all the food choices in there it did seem the most interesting one.\n\nGot the Capastrami and I must say it was nothing short of amazing. Juicy without being sloppy (in fact there was not sloppiness at all) and just the right amount of dressings and meat. The pastrami itself was flavorful and juicy with a hint of fresh spices and the serving was very generous. Next time I'll try the Bobbie which is their most famous sandwich and was told it tastes like \"Thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form\".\n\nThe prices are a bit on the high side (paid about $9.5 for it) and there might not always be a table to sit in but that should not prevent anyone from trying it, especially if you happen to be in the Santa Fe Station.",

  "text": "Yes, five stars. I went in on Wednesday for lunch, came back on Thursday for dinner, and I'm still trying to figure out how I can go back again ASAP. The location is cute and clean, the service is engaging and informative, and the food is tasty and fresh!\n\nThey're marketed as a rotisserie, and their chicken plates are a highlight, but I have so far stuck to their sandwiches.  The porchetta is amazing, hearty and juicy with a nice crispy skin for contrast, piled on a hearty artisan roll with arugula, parsley gremolata, and a lemon sauce. It was a fantastic lunch, and I didn't eat for the rest of the day because I was so full.\n\nThe tri-tip sandwich was also tasty, with a heap of caramelized onions and a really great garlic sauce for kick. This paired well with their fries, and again, it was a humongous portion. They have seasonal soups; I preferred the beef over the chicken. Their warm and chewy pita chips are my favorite version I've come across; the $4 portion with creamy hummus is huge enough to be a meal in itself.\n\nBoth visits have treated me to lots of staff interaction, from answering my annoying questions about the food to trying samples of other dishes and getting detailed info about their menu and concept. Everyone here is very friendly and everything is made fresh in house, from the sauces to the breads and everything in between. Looking forward to coming back for their chicken pita next time!\n\nEDIT: Returned for the chicken pita! It was bomb, and so healthy too. The green goddess dressing is delicious, they really do have amazing sauces here. Sided my order with the the Brussels sprouts, which are nearly the size of golf balls, and lightly roasted and seasoned. Perfection again!",

  "text": "I've eaten several menu items from this truck. It's found all over town, but they usually are where the Food Truck Party is scheduled each week and worthy of trying. The guys working are nice and seem to genuinely care about putting out quality food that tastes great. When you place your order don't expect to get handed food right away. They make everything to order and it can take time, but it's well worth it. \n\nJamon Iberico ($13) - This is some tasty ham! The split-top rolls that they grill in butter really hold the fillings in nicely and tastes great. While I like this sandwich, I actually recommend the quesadilla which is stuffed with iberico ham, mushrooms and mozzarella. \n\nPatatas Bravas ($7) - This is a full portion, but you can add a smaller version for $3 to any meal. The menu describes this as fried potato wedges with Barcelona style spicy sauce. I like the patatas bravas a lot, but the flavor hasn't been consistent each time. Sometimes the sauce it much spicier than other times and even has a different color. \n\nVaca Saltada ($11) - Braised beef, manchego cheese, red onion, spicy yellow chili mayo on a split-top roll grilled in butter and topped with pretty edible flowers. The beef has great flavor and all the fillings compliment each other well. This sandwich was well liked by all in my group that tried it. \n\nCroquetas ($7) - There's chicken inside these fried tasty gems. You get 4 of them in the order and side of Parmesan cheese bechamel for dipping. I feel like you should get at least 5 of them for the price given how small they are, but they do taste good. \n\nThey also have chicken, sausage and veggie options. Check their social media pages to see where the truck will be next.",

  "text": "I often stop here for a bite to eat after I am done shopping, but I often call ahead to order a whole pizza for pick up. The people working have always been friendly and great about the large orders I've placed for parties. Whole pizzas are 18 inches, priced at $9.95 and you can choose from cheese, combo or pepperoni. I have asked for just sausage on a whole pizza before and since the whole ones are made to order they didn't mind customizing the pie with the toppings of my choice, so just let them know when ordering a whole pizza what you'd like on it. My hubby likes the hot dogs and I do as well from time to time like one with mustard and sauerkraut, both of which are options over by the condiments section where you can dress your dog. The hot dogs are only $1.50 and come with a 20 ounce (free refills) drink. Churros for a buck, sandwiches and the very berry sundae are also offered. It's nice that after all of these years with the price of everything going up that Costco still offers cheap and tasty eats in their food court.",

  "text": "This is probably the go to place for a hangout eat or just a late night grab... came in with a good size group of friends at 8pm. Most of our group had the endless apps , a go to choice by many. I had the steak and lobster with two sides... Their food was prompt and accurate; however, my order took 41 minutes. Not only was everyone else on their 4th appetizer by the time I received my food, it was not cooked as ordered. My fries were soggy with blood,  and the lobster tail was grilled from the outer layer and raw underneath. After bringing it up to the waiter's attention he just said he would take it back without any acknowledgment to the mistake or wait time.  Decided to bring it up the manager,PAUL,for constructive criticism and before I finished explaining everything he interrupted with \"the appetizers take a while\" . .. I don't know where he usually dines at or how long he's been in customer service but that's unacceptable. There is no way you can tell me that you'll serve the whole table until they can't eat anymore before putting in my order. I'm a paying customer, I shouldn't have to wait for the fourth round of endless apps to get my order. Another tip, before you give a customer a ridiculous excuse.... it wouldn't kill you to address the issue and apologize for the inconvenience. Just $25 down the drain, if you're considering TGIF just make sure you're not hungry if you're ordering anything that doesn't fall under endless apps.",

  "text": "This Capriotti's is located inside the food court (where Lone Mountain Buffet used to be) inside Sante Fe Station. You can place a phone order or walk right up to the counter and order. There is plenty of tables with seating in the food court and the area is usually pretty clean. I have had both the Capastrami and Bobbie from this location several times and it's been constantly tasty. The employees are friendly and I like that they accept the rewards from their app as well coupons that come to my e-mail. Having the app gets you freebies like cookies, drinks and sandwich upgrades as well a free sandwich after purchasing so many. Make sure to check the bottom of your receipt they sometimes have discounts towards your next purchase. This is a decent place to grab a sandwich hot or cold.\n\nCapastrami ($8.49 for a small) - Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw. This is definitely my favorite sandwich at Cap's. The coleslaw is made fresh daily and it just tastes good. I order it to-go often and it's still hot and delicious by the time i get home to eat it. \n\nThe Bobbie ($7.59 for a small) - Homemade Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. It's like they took all the leftovers from Thanksgiving and put it between bread for the ultimate leftover Thanksgiving sandwich. The turkey is made fresh at each location and hand-pulled. I really liked how this last Thanksgiving they had the option to add a side of gravy, score! Where has this gravy been? Please bring the gravy back as a regular menu item because it pairs so nicely with The Bobbie! This is the perfect sandwich to pack for a picnic lunch, hike or to take with you to work for lunch because it holds up well. \n\nThe bread for the Cap's locations here in Vegas and Henderson come locally from Great Buns Bakery and is delivered fresh to each location. \n\nSizes are as follows and it's worth noting because to this day I see people ordering a large and then they get so surprised at how big it is:\n\nLarge - 20 inches\nMedium - 12 inches\nSmall - 9 inches",

  "text": "Just Opened and if the poor service and high prices keeps up it might soon end up Just Closed.\n\nI miss the New York delis. I had looked forward to Canter's coming to Summerlin. As it turned out, the place is infested with astronomical prices and infinestimal service. My brother was so disgusted by his $20 pastrami sandwich plus $3 for a side dish that he wrote his second Yelp review.\n\nI knew that Canter's was opening a second Las Vegas location on the Strip. In the front of my mind I knew that if a pastrami sandwich is close to $20 in Summerlin, it would be off the charts expensive on the Las Vegas Strip. When all is said and done, I wasn't chomping at the bit for this Canter's to open.\n\nThroughout this week we'd pass through the Linq between the Orleans shuttle stop and the Strip. Near the High Roller on an empty storefront door there was a small sign saying that Canter's is Coming Soon. I was surprised when I was walking in the Linq when my olfactory senses alerted me to Canter's. Only a few hours ago, it was an empty storefront. Canter's had just opened a couple of hours ago. Expecting price shock I asked if there was a take out menu. The friendly lady said they had been open about an hour and that I can take pictures of the menu. I did just that, then outside the Linq evaluated the choices. Astonishingly a pastrami sandwich on the Strip is a few dollars less than the exact one in Summerlin. And astonishingly, this deli does not offer the very popular deli staple: kosher. However, they do offer an egg salad sandwich, which is not too common in Las Vegas. So, I followed my olfactory senses back to the aroma of deli food. Disparite from the majority of the menu, the price for the egg salad sandwich is fair. The egg salad sandwich with the choice of bread (including a bagel) and two sides is $9.25 and a bottomless plastic cup of a Coke product is $3.\n\nThe same friendly employee that greeted me a few minutes previous nicely told me to seat myself. In this large room filled with Canter pictures and a new restaurant scent, I sat myself then waited and waited and waited. I'd even change my seat to the center of this uncrowded newly opened deli. Finally a server asked me what I wanted to drink. A Coke ($3).He'd place the drink on the table then the service disappeared. It seemed that I likewise disappeared. Servers just passed me by. Service was nonexistent. I'd see the staff standing at the entrance of the kitchen. I'd even see a manager seated at a table across from me that failed to acknowledge me. Then there was an employee sweeping that failed to acknowledge me. Nobody offered me a menu, although I assume that I was supposed to take one when I served myself. After approximately twenty minutes of being the invisible man, I preferred to be a visible man and exchange my hard earned money with a waitstaff that acknowledges me.\n\nOn its first day of opening, Canter's does not have a bug to fix. Just common sense! If somebody is seated for twenty minutes without a menu, there is a good chance that he might want somebody to acknowledge him and place a menu on the table so that he could order something. Possibly even a $17 pastrami sandwich. Canter's needs to offer more deli food that reflects on their original location. This includes Kashe. Finally Canter's needs to rethink their pricing strategy.\n\n....................\nReviewer's note: I gave 2 stars instead of 1 optimistic that the Management team will read this review and fix the issues discussed in this review. Las Vegas has a shortage of delis. If Canter's Management addresses these drawbacks it has the potential to provide a much needed good deli in the Las Vegas market.",

  "text": "Another Thai joint in the SW? Why not!? :) We were here for a late dinner with the kids and wanted to try the new Thai restaurant nearby. I remembered this place used to be another Thai restaurant a while back. I was super excited when I saw the sign \"Amazing Thai 2\". \n\nLocation: This Thai joint is located next to 808 sushi and AT&T store, in the same plaza with the Vons at Rhodes Ranch. It is a multi- stores plaza with huge parking lot, so finding a parking should not be a problem. \n\nDecor: Apparently, Amazing Thai did a great make over of this small cute place and made their own style. I loved what they did to this place, it was modern, looked brighter and chic. \n\nService was a two thumbs up. The server greeted us with smile when we walked in. Filled my hot tea and the kid's drinks. Service was fast, efficient, and attentive. \n\nWe were able to tried couple of their favorites: \n\nAppetizer : \nCrab rangoon: it was standard, nothing too special about it but we liked it. Two thumbs up on food presentation of this appetizer. And my kids loved the sauce. \n\nEntrees: \n- Pad Woon Sen with Chicken: this pan fried glass noodle with egg, veggies and mushroom was my kid's all time favorite. Their portion was generous and had extra noodles. The glass noodles was perfectly cooked and it was tasty. \n- Crab fried rice: another my kid's favorite dish. It was delicious with generous size of crab meat. \n- Khao Soi with beef: This was a Northern Thai specialized dish and not many Thai restaurant offered it. In Thai, they would used hand cut noodles (all hand made), and you could add your own choices of protein.  It was so fresh and delicious! Back to Amazing Thai 2, I was not fond of the beef texture, it was not tender and a little too dried. I also wished they used a different kind of noodle, a more flat egg noodle to maintain its texture after soaked together with the soup . I did LOVE the coconut curry soup based! It was on the sweeter side, but since I requested spicy level number 5, it was a perfect sweet spicy combination at the end. Overall, I thought Amazing Thai 2 did well on this dish.\n\nDesert: We had mango sticky rice and it was an average. Not a fan of the mango choices (used a different kind, not the sweet Thai mango). The sticky rice was not cooked thoroughly, some was way undercooked. I did like the coconut sauce and had to give extra credits on presentation. It was cute and neat. \n\nI will definitely come back and try their other favorite dishes and unique deserts (hint: their pot ice cream).",

If you look very carefully you might see us licking the pan for the rest of the octopus. Staff is very nice! Even if there is sometimes a bit of a language barrier we all figure it out and always get what we ask for. Would and have recommended Mar Y Tierra to friends.",

I got the veggie version of the roast beef and slaw sub, and my dad got the Bobby.\nI was disappointed to see that they skimped on the soy turkey, so it was essentially all slaw. The Bobby was perfect though, so it just seems like they skimp out on the veggie subs at this location. \nThey also have a soda fountain that is accessable by patrons, so that's nice- you don't have to ask them for a refill, just get your own.",

I was, therefore, pleased, when Elite Las Vegas Yelper, Christie graciously invited me to meet her and her husband, Marc for a bite at Capriotti's, during my recent Vegas vacation.\n\nI ordered the Cole Turkey(turkey, coleslaw, provolone and Russian dressing on a hero). I bit in and loved the fresh taste of the turkey, the crispness of the cole slaw, the nicely melted cheese, the tasty soft bread and the great flavor imparted by the Russian dressing. I virtually inhaled the sandwich.It was as good, or better, than the Cheese Steak sandwiches I had eaten in the past..........And, more importantly, my experience at Capriotti's on 7/21 was made immensely more memorable because I shared it with new friends.\n\nCapriotti's is another franchise that needs to come to lower New York.",

Served with homemade potato salad, which was literally the best I've  ever had. Ham, turkey, roast beef are the cold selections. Served on a disposable plate :) plenty of deli and counter seating right there. There are hot choices as well, along with burgers.\n\nWe played some slots right around the deli that seemed really loose. Too bad we were on a schedule!",

They were overcooked and soggy. The wontons were obviously store bought from 99 ranch or the likes and probably the cheapest kind you can find. There were meager servings for Chinese cabbage in it, and it was overcooked and not crunchy on the inside. And don't get me started on the broth, er i mean the water that they passed as soup. There was no flavor at all. I would have expected a place that has a great\"international buffet\" to have a somewhat decent  \"Cantonese\" food.\n\nPerhaps I'm being too harsh. Perhaps I expect too much. I want my 9 dollars back. Not only it was 9 dollars, but it was served in a crappy ass plastic bowl and the nastiest kind of chopsitcks you can find (which I had to ASK FOR- they gave me a fork!)

As a server I always try to give other servers second chances to correct mistakes they make while out eating. Our servers name was Holly not only did she take 20 minutes to bring us water and 2 beers which she messed up in the size, she was also very rude! When we asked her if she had put our order in for our beer she had the nerve to roll her eyes at us for her mistake! We went for happy hour and we were planning on ordering some more appetizers for our group but she was no where to be found, it's as if she hid for long periods of time waiting for happy hour to end. I try not to judge a server for being slow or even a little forgetful because we all make mistakes including my self, but being rude for your own mistakes is uncalled for. We do appreciate the manager who was working at the time, because he was understanding and he did try fixing the crappy experience she gave us. He was very professional and kind, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to fix the rude attitude she brought to our table. We won't ever be back to this location!",

It's the perfect sandwich for this type of season, I should have bought a bunch to take it for a picnic.\n\nIf your looking for small bites the croquetas is a must have, They are deep fried into balls and stuffed with chicken, parmesan cheese and bechamel. After one bite I will never eat mozzarella sticks again, this tastes 1000x better so creamy and cheesy.    \nI hadn't tried everything on the menu, but by looks of it each item has had a lot of thought put into it. \n\nThis food truck is outstanding if you happen to find them, don't hesitate to check them out.",

Oh and bring me one\" says my SoCal poker bud.\n\n15 miles later, at the Las Vegas Farmers Market (Rampart and Vegas Drive) sitting on a park bench, now munching on my SoCal poker buds sandwiches. huge Cheshire Cat grin, feeling no guilt; \"You had your chance\".\n\nOne of the BEST food trucks in Vegas.\n\nIt's specializes in a small sampling of Barcelona Street food adapted to American taste.  Not 100% authentic, All good, just enjoy your food outdoors while you people watch.  You'll feel transported.\n\nCredit where credit is due: thanks Stefany V for the recommendation.\n\nBocadillos, traditional Barcelona sandwiches, feature OUTSTANDING fresh bread with flavor, slightly chewy, toasted crisp that manages to hold everything in perfectly.  Amped up mayo and spreads and fresh veg and micro greens that actually make sense (the flavor of the micro greens adds to the enjoyment of the sandwich).  Proteins, very well chosen and blend well with everything.  The Jamon Serrano, sweet porky goodness and cured funk that pairs well with the mushrooms.  The Botifarra; naturally cased, coarse ground seasoned pork; delicious and fatty, intensified by a great chimichurri mojo verde.  Finally the vaca saltada; braised beef with manchego cheese and an earthy chili mayo, just plain good eats.\n\nDo try an order of patas bravas (deep fried thick potato wedges with a spicy aioli).  Fluffy on the inside, gently crisp on the outside, it makes a perfect, rich side to any sandwich.\n\nNote: If you have not tried Iberico ham from black footed, acorn fed pigs, AND it's on offer here, go for it.  It might not be as good as that sold by places on the Strip but at 1/3 the price, unless you're a true gourmand, your tongue won't know the difference.\n\nPrices are in line with the quality.  No foot long subs for $5 here.\n\nIf they only sold wine by the glass and that other famous Barcelona street food, churros.  Ahhhhh.\n\nBe sure to check out their FB, IG, Twitter, and website to see where they are going to pop-up next.\n\nAn amazing food truck, well worth seeking out.",

The staff knows us and know how we like our Super Nachos and NEVER give us any problems with our unusual requests! Kind of bummed they charge for the Horchata refills now but it's all good. It's understandable since people like my family can down like 3-4 cups each in one sitting. I apologize that I don't know them by name but the two ladies (one elder and one pretty young) and the younger man that usually takes our orders are always so nice! Thanks!",

  "text": "Posit, all great sandwiches (that we want to eat) are unhealthy.  Pastrami, corned beef, brisket, pulled pork,  a burger, italian salumi and porchetta.  Veg?  Sigh, if you must but make sure it's grilled and hammered to death or wilting from the meat fat.\n\nKarved makes one heck of a great sandwich.  Porchetta.  Take a lean pork tenderloin.  Roll it inside a pork belly, it's skin on the outside.  Season heavily.  Rotisserie roast until golden brown, cracklin on the outside,  juicy, and fatty in all the right ways on the inside.  Slice that bad boy up.  Shove it in a fresh baked, chewy, crispy baguette, wilt up some greens, add a generous slathering of herbaceous, lemony, garlicky gremolata.  Heaven.  The crispy pork cracklin adds great texture while the sweetness of the pork is brought out by the bright gremolata.  An outstanding sandwich.  A solid value at $12.\n\nAlso available, a rotisserie chicken and tri-tip.  Ordered as a plate, the chicken is as good as any.  The tri-tip, well seasoned, cooked medium, tender, juicy, it's flavor brought to life by the spice heat of an aji verde (Peruvian green chili sauce).  OK roasted Brussels sprouts that could use more char for complexity.  All good, this place is all about the porchetta.\n\nFriendly local service.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say it's so epic and iconic, ie drive from Centennial great, if you're in the area, a very worthy treat.",

T came with refried beans and rice, both of which were on the same level as any I've had down in Mexico itself. I ordered the taco to be chicken, which was very tender and tasty. The enchilada was cheese, my favorite, and was just as good as any I've had south of the border. The chips were thin and crispy, just like I like them and the salsa had an excellent bite to it. Overall, the best Mexican food I've had since coming back from Baja last October. If you like good, real Mexican, you won't be disappointed. Don't let the \"dive-y\" look deter you from pushing the door open and going in. You won't be disappointed either! \n\nOh yeah, they have real Mexican Coca-Cola in a bottle, too. If you've never had one, you'll be surprised at how different they taste from our Coke in the U.S. Try it!",

You can even hire them to cater private parties.\n\nThe short menu comprises bocatas, patatas bravas, and croquetas. A bocata (or bocadillo) is a Spanish sandwich and Chef Oscar presents his version beautifully on a soft roll crisped up with butter on the griddle. I asked about a vegetarian option and he served up a bocata with mushrooms, zucchini, red onion, bell peppers, bok choy, and delicious romesco sauce. I was dining al fresco at Bruce Trent Park, but it could have easily been Jaleo. Chef has a Jose Andres accent.\n\nI will be tracking down Boqueria Street very soon for an order of patatas bravas!",

  "text": "I guess Church's Chicken is a brand name so you've either made up your mind about that brand, or have yet to try that brand, but for the most part you're going there for the brand name and not a unique experience. On the other hand though, this is an odd one. This used to be Philly Cheese Steak restaurant and it was one of those walk up or drive thru only type of deals that had no dining room. That store went down probably because of it's service. I remember that restaurant had a best Philly Cheese Steak of Las Vegas rating from the Las Vegas Review Journal for like 2 years in a row back in like 2001, 2002 or something like that. Then I remember ordering a a sandwich and waiting 45 freakin' minutes for a freakin turkey cheese steak sandwich and some fries. 45 freakin' minutes in somewhat cold weather because it was just turning into fall and I left the house without a jacket not thinking that it would be so cold, or that I would have to wait 45 freakin' minutes for one sandwich when I was the ONLY ONE standing in front of that place. I actually remember that when I was waiting for my order, a car that was ordering something through the drive thru cursed out one of the employees because he was waiting and it was his lunch break and he was pissed. Needless to say, that place got shut down a few months after. The had a decent sandwich but not worth 45 minutes of waiting... OUTSIDE!    IN LAS VEGAS!!!!! The conditions are never good outside here. It's either too hot, too cold, or windy as hell....It stayed shut down for about 3 years. \n \n   I believe it was somewhere around this time last year when Church's Chicken took over. I don't remember ever going to a Church's Chicken so I figured I'd give it a try. Initially I wanted to dine in but I soon realized that they didn't have a dining room. Either way, I wanted to try it and I walked up to the window. This was around 6-7pm, right in the middle of the night time rush and the window is facing one of the busiest streets in Vegas, Nellis Blvd....PLUS it was windy outside so I basically had to yell my order at the guy three times before he was able to hear what I said and he had to repeat it to me just a many times till he got the #whatever with the beans and extra corn, or whatever I ordered right. \n\n   As bad as that was, there was already two people that ordered before me. I guess the first person ordered a large order and had to wait a bit for her order. I think she ordered a bucket of something or an office trash can or whatever they put 20 pieces of chicken in. Anyway, both the person after her and eventually my orders came before hers and every time the window would open, that lady would walk up to the window and say \"that's not my order\". Well she was right but they never called her order for pick up in the first place. She did that again with my order and asked where the chicken was ( I ordered some chicken finger meal that all fit in one bag) and once again the guy had to say that it wasn't her order. Again. \n\n   I already was not liking this place, but I got my order and took it home. I ordered a meal that had the chicken strips, fries, a biscuit and a piece of corn..... The corn was good.... The chicken strips were really dry and all I remember was that NEEDED to eat it with the BBQ sauce and as soon as I ran out I stopped eating the chicken. The fries were garbage. They were this mix of being soggy and hard at the same time. It's as if they fried them and let them sit in the fryer but turned the heat off and just let them sit there. I barely even ate those fries. The biscuit was good though. They have those biscuits with the honey-butter baked into them. I wish I had some extra honey to spread on it instead of butter. The corn was...well it was corn. If they screwed that up then I would have left my house with that corn in my hand, go back to the store and break that window with it but luckily for them it was good. After all, all they had to do was throw it in some boiling water for a while. \n\n   Overall, I just did not like the place. I know that I didn't get the signature chicken wings that you're supposed to go there for but I still got something they were offering on their menu so either do it good or don't do it at all. There's a KFC, Wing Stop, and a Popeye's all within a block away from this place and any one of those are a better option for your fried chicken needs.",

This location is different than the other two in that there is very little parking right outside but in my opinion this is the nicest. Like the southwest restaurant this one had a retractable glass wall that allows for open air dining. \n\nThey have many vegan, vegetarian, GF options that are clearly marked on the menu, making it super easy for people like me. Also you can sub grilled or fried tofu for almost all of the meats on the menu for additional vegetarian and vegan choices. \n\nI ordered the \"Stuff on Curry\" which was pad Thai noodles with a curry sauce and fried chickpeas.

It's nothing fancy, but they still make a good pastrami sandwich (albeit lighter), sliced to order. Unfortunately, they no longer sell Dr. Brown's soda.\n\nPony up to the counter and enjoy a taste of old school Vegas!",

It was actually pretty plain.\n\nHad a chance to taste shrimp pad thai (I know, pad thai at a Chinese place?), chow fun, and sweet and sour pork.  I've had things taste better at a Panda Inn.  \n\nTheir versions of Pad Thai and Chow Fun were not good examples of how to cook noodles.  Both were on the chewy side.\n\nI usually like any kind of sweet and sour pork, but they were on the salty gooey side.  I don't know why I went back to try other items at this place, I should have known by the way they cook noodles.  I won't be back.",

I usually go back and forth between the Bobbie and the Capistrami, and this time, I wanted a hot sandwich so I got a Capistrami before going to the movies. The combination and contrast of the hot pastrami combined with the cold slaw and russian dressing makes this an addicting sandwich that you take one bite after another until there is no more!\n\nI ended up sneaking the other half of my sandwich in because we weren't keeping track of time and didn't wanna end up with junk seats, That was a great sandwich, and I prefer that any day over a bucket of outrageously priced popcorn with that fake butter...ALOHA!!!\n\nYELP 365 CHALLENGE-(150/365) \"The Smuggled Sandwich\"",

In an already tight parking lot, there will soon be less parking once the majority of Vegas learns about this delicious joint.\n\nQuite possibly the star of the menu is their Porchetta sandwich.  One of the staff (possibly the owner?) walked me through the steps it took to create this flavorful masterpiece.  Totaling a three to four hour process, pork tenderloin is first rolled inside pork belly, then cooked rotisserie-style, and sliced up into juicy, tender pieces.  These are tossed into a fresh, chewy baguette slathered with a lemon caper gremolata spread and some greens.   If that isn't enough, pork cracklins are tossed over the sandwich to add a nice crunch to the mix.  It's just a burst full of flavor and truly makes this one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.\n\nMy wife and I also enjoyed the combo Peruvian Chicken and Beef tri-tip combo platter with potatoes, rice, and brussel sprouts on the side.  Three sauces were all sampled and three sauces were well-liked.   Hot, aji verde, and garlic all accentuated the flavors of the meat.   The portions were generous enough to eat for lunch and have saved some left over for dinner.\n\nThe staff members were attentive, friendly, and thankful.  Likewise, I am thankful for this small establishment for bringing another fantastic food option here in Las Vegas.",

Service was great. We sat at a booth far away from the casino floor, which was great. Ordered a strawberry lemonade as I always do along with a dish I've never tried before: Fettuccine Alfredo pasta with shrimp. A large Caesar salad and new england clam chowder. The chowder was sort of thin and could have been better, but it is what it is for $4 bucks. The salad was good along with the main course. The shrimp was nice and tender. The pasta was soft and the alfred sauce tasted great, especially with some pepper. Will always return to TGI Fridays just never know what location! :-)",

The food was really good.  (I was unable to order a full meal as I was still quite full from lunch; however, I had a really yummy half-salad and a grilled Italian sausage, and they were delicious.)  Fresh, ciabatta type bread with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and/or lots of butter was served throughout the meal.  I had a taste of the meals of the people on either side of me--eggplant parm (which was the best I've ever had) and a seafood angel hair pasta dish (excellent).  Although the grilled Italian sausage is not on the menu (it's ordinarily served in sauce) they grilled it for me and served it to me that way--exactly as I requested--which is good service in my book.  It was a side order and served w/sauce on the side--very nice.  The tiramisu dessert was much better than average and beautifully presented.",

Not being in a rush, we said we'd wait & got our pastrami sandwich & drink. After waiting about 15 minutes I decide to check with the person we ordered from if the hot dogs were ready. I was then told that they don't have hot dogs. Confused, I reiterated what I was told earlier about waiting for the buns but was ignored & told that they don't have either. Another worker had showed up & entered our conversation asking, \"do you REALLY want a hot dog?\", which to me says, \"we're closing soon & we don't really want to correct what we did wrong, but I'll offer it up with a bit of sarcasm anyway\".  That also pissed me off just a bit. So, I ended up eating the other half of the pastrami sandwich (which was ok, not the best pastrami ever, by any means). Had I been originally told that they were out I would have just ordered something else & not have anything to grumble about. Buuuuuut, this was not the case which caused me some major irritation.\n\nSo, food is ok, service is terrible. I'd much rather go to the cafe in the Cal. At least when they're out of something they let you know instead of making you wait for nothing.",

I guess someone ordered nachos but they were in the restroom and she kept yelling \"nachos, whoever ordered nachos, your food is ready!\" She just left them on the counter and said, \"well she paid for them already so ...\" I feel that customer service is really important, there are plenty of other places people can go where they'll get better service.

But, the quality has dipped a bit a couple of months ago but, somehow, I keep coming back hoping that maybe they would magically improve like in the beginning.  But, it's the same everytime.  The only thing I like about this Roberto's is that they usually get my order right and the workers are nice, but it still pushing me over to Rivas for some better eat and the refillable fountain drink machine.",

  "text": "This is the worse Friday's there is out there. Every time we come here the cooks mess something up. Went here last night at that was my final straw. There's was only 7-8 tables occupied as it was still early. We went for the steak and lobster. The server was nice but it's always the cooks that don't give a crap. Ordered a steak with no seasoning and on the flat grill. 45 minutes go by and still no food. How long does it take to cook 3 meals when the place is dead?! They finally bring out out and guess what, there's seasoning on it. Due to having a sensitive stomach seasoning is out of the question. Sent it back are the rest of the meal and another 20 minutes go by and they finally being another steak. Guess what they did, rinsed it off and threw it back on the grill. It was obvious as underneath there was still some seasoning underneath. The steak was now burned not the medium well that was ordered it was well done and burned. When the manager was questioned why there was still seasoning he lied and said there wasn't even thought it was in the juice on the plate and in the napkin that I dabbed it with. \n\nAlso another order was the jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. On the menu it said a full rack of ribs. They brought out a 1/2 rack. I questioned the server and he said they only do 1/2. We were too annoyed at the steak situation but I should have asked for a menu because they charged me for something that I didn't get. See menu photo from their website. What a joke and in the end a waste of more than an hour and a half. Also never bothered to enter my stripes number so I got no credit. Will never return to this place and I live close by. I'll drive to outback or Millers where they know how to cook right and provide better service!",

  "text": "COSTCO FOOD COURT IS THE BOMB!\n\nEvery time I shop here at Costco, more often then not, I end up eating at the food court. So of course I always end up looking to check in and nada, zip, zilch, nothing! So now for all of you that are reading this, HOORAY! You can check in now! Maybe it will get you some type of badge.\n\nAs everybody knows, the Costco Food Court has some of the best tasting food at prices that everybody loves! Let's see, you got your choice of either a Polish or All American Hot Dog that comes with a drink for $1.50! Can I get an AMEN! A Chicken Bake for $2.99, a Toasted Ciabatta Turkey Sandwich for $3.99, and some other items that catch your eye as well like a huge slice of either Cheese, Pepperoni, or Combination pizza for umm......damn I cant remember cuz I only order it for my kids.\n\nAnyways, you guys get what im saying. They have something for everybody and its not too hard on your wallet. I say the price you pay for the membership alone is worth it just for the food court!\n\nThe only downfall that irks me is that they only take cash. You would think that since you can pay with either debit or American Express at the front registers that these guys would have the same set up. NOT! Although you can pay for whatever you wanna get at the food court at the front registers is a little better, that still is kind of a hassle.\n\nIn the end, I have yet to have a bad experience with the service and food every time I eat here. Imagine a Costco thats 24 hours. Now THATS something to behold! It IS Vegas so you never know. In the meantime, I can always go for a hot dog or turkey sandwich.",

Very un-inviting.  Really looks like they were not ready to open to be quite honest.  Why do restaurant do this to themselves.\n\nI looked around and it seems like there is supposed to be a hostess but just empty dining room.\n\nI work in the LINQ so after I ordered my 2 pastrami sandwiches and drinks for over $40 dollars I did want to get my discount.  The cashier had to leave the front counter to find a manager to give me my discount so this took a while.  With hardly no one in line it seems like it was so difficult for what should be a simple transaction.  \n\nWith so many other good options that are more reasonably priced the is not the place to go.  They also do not have any TV's anywhere so if I wasn't at work I would like to be able to see some of the playoff games but they don't have that either.  Oh yeah they also don't have any restrooms!!!  Seriously guys.  Wow.  Lots and lots of work to do if you have any chance of remaining competitive. \n\nSurprised that the Canter's in LA is really part of this dismal representation of what I love so dearly on Fairfax.",

More time passed my food was ready. No beverage so AGAIN I asked could I please have a sweet tea.  Surprise  Surprise no sweet tea. So I asked can I get something else. Hated to bother them and their conversation .  I was not even phased until once home I unpacked dinner for everyone and not only did I only have 7 NOT 8 pieces of chicken they did not included my 4 biscuits and the cheese jalapeno poppers were so overdone their was no cheese left in them.

Their fairly limited menu has deli sandwiches (as you might expect), plus hot dogs, hamburgers, soups and stews, salads, some breakfast fare, and frozen custards.\n\nPrices are not expensive. My patty melt was a nicely cooked good-sized burger with fresh lettuce, tomato, and grilled onions on sliced marble rye.  Served with potato salad and a big pickle, ran just $7.99. It was pretty excellent! \n\nSoft drinks are only available in one size, and that will run you $2.99.  That price did seem kind of piggish to me.\n\nAnyway, the food was good and service was fast and friendly.",

They were full of so much flavor,  or to mention the guacamole that came with it.  The owner, Jos\u00e9, came out and welcomed us.  We talked with him the whole time we were there.  He and his wife were so pleasant.  They were so polite, and very appreciative of us for coming in to their restaurant.  I will definitely be returning, and will be making recommendations to friends who will be coming into Las Vegas for El Cordobes restaurant.  Thanks, Jos\u00e9!",

  "text": "I grew up on good Jewish Deli. I am the daughter of a Philly Deli man. I was very excited to hear that a Jewish Deli was opening in the Linq Promenade. That excitement quickly turned to great disappoint when I got there. The corned beef is nothing but thick pieces of warmed brisket. Same for the pastrami. That is NOT how Jewish Deli is made! It must be cooked fresh in the store and sliced thinly on a meat slicer. Once it is put in a refrigerator, the good taste turns bad. Canter's does not cook their deli meats in the store. They buy it so you know it has already been refrigerated. Then, they heat it up and chop it with a knife into large chunks. Their rye bread is NOT authentic Jewish bakery rye. Who are they kidding? People who have never had good Jewish Deli on bakery rye -- that's who!!! The only good thing I had was picked green tomatoes (we call them sour tomatoes) because they were purchased from a good supplier. If you advertise that you're a Jewish Deli, then you damn well better be a Jewish Deli. Otherwise, it is false advertising!!!",

  "text": "Terrible, terrible customer service. Very bad experience with ordering a pizza. Paid for two whole pizza with Costco card. Was told by cashier it would be 10-15 minutes. Set timer on phone for 15 minutes, had teenaged son to check on order 12 minutes in. He came back to wait area said lady cashier said it would be 25 minutes but she did not sound too sure.\n\nAfter 3 more minutes when 15minute timer went off. I spoke to another cashier in food court and showed her my paid receipt and asked how much longer. She went back to where the pizza orders were and spoke to some guy and came back and said order was never processed and that I was suppose to let them know I wanted them to start making my pizza. Go figure, I thought me paying for and ordering the pizza was indication I wanted them to make pizzas. \n\nI was then told it would be another 15 or 20 minutes for them to make the pizza. I set my timer again, and went to the original cashier who said that it would be 10-15 minutes. He had this stunned look on his face, until his assistant told him very quietly you have to let them know to make the pizza. He apologized and then tried say it was up to me to let the food court know I wanted them to make pizza I had paid for. \n\nThen when the 15 timer went off again, we went to check on pizza; our pizzas were sitting their waiting, you would think they would have hand delivered after the numerous mixups when they were ready.\n\nI have ordered pizzas before at other Costco locations without all of this confusion. I won't be using this location's food court - #737 again!",

There were only three different wines which didn't start until we were on our third course.  The sauvignon blanc served with the lobster didn't pair at all.  My wife's seared sea bass was tempura-ed and very fishy.  Normally, when one orders a paired wine service, that service includes poring the wine in front of the guest with a brief description of the wine and why it was chosen for that particular course.  The only piece of information we received was, \"this is an xxxx, enjoy\".  \n\nPositives:  The staff was very attentive and accommodating.  The space is extremely pleasant and relaxing.  The Pinot Noir and desert Muscat were excellent.  (It would have been nice to have seen the bottle they were poured from.  I would have found them at the wine store and purchase a few bottles.)\n\nI think we might go back sometime and try ordering A la carte.",

Regardless, I had a long day without food so I basically went for the first restaurant I saw in Rio. I ordered the duck noodle soup because it did not sound that bad. I thought the duck was actually alright the skin was crispy and there was actually a large portion of duck on my noodles. However, a lot less could be said for the noodles. The noodles were so dry and hard.. not fresh noodles at all more like instant ramen texture. Considering I paid 10 bucks for it they could at least use fresh noodles?

I have this theory that the greasy the food the better the alcky doesnt soak in your stomach. haha! The first night we got there we were in a rush to head out to XS, so we stopped down here since we were staying at the Rio. \n\nThe prices for the dishes range around 10-12 dollars for the main dishes. You might think these prices are steep but its family style and the portions are pretty big! We had the general chicken which came with a bowl of rice, and chow fun. Everything was nicely cooked and not over seasoned which I came to the conclusion that there probably wasnt MSG in the meal which is always a bonus. They have a full stock of condomints: soy sauce, sriracha, garlic chili sauce, hot mustard, sweet sour sauce and many more. I also liked that the cooks in the back were old chinese guys so you know the food has to be sorta legit hahaha.  The last night there we had the food again, this time me and my gf split the hot and sour soup and the Singapore noodles. Now that I look at the pictures of the duck, I should of ordered that too.",

Our \"nice\" dinner quickly (or should I say, very slowly) turned horrible.\n\nWhen we walked up, we were greeted by a nice hostess who promptly seated us.  This was the last pleasant moment.  We ordered an appetizer, which took 30 minutes to get to us (mind that there were only 3-5 other couples dining).  I eventually had to tell the manager that we had yet to receive our appetizer -- 30 seconds later he returned with it.  I will mention that our server walked by us approximately 20 times during our wait, without making eye contact or apologizing at all.\n\nAbout 1 minute after finishing our appetizer, another waiter (who we had not seen all night) brought us our entrees without even removing the appetizer plate.  The food looked horrible, as if it had been sitting in a steam tray all day.  I had ordered the Hong Kong style noodles, which were thrown in a cheap, green-tinted pyrex serving tray and looked like one giant glob of noodle.  The sauce was bland.  The shrimp had a nice flavor to it, but that was about it.\n\nMy fiancee ordered Egg braised tofu with abalone sauce, and it essentially was fried tofu slathered in a disgusting looking gravy on a bed of creamed cabbage.\n\nBoth my fiancee and I have traveled the world extensively and have eaten fare from numerous countries and this was by far the poorest \"authentic\" cuisine we had ever tasted.\n\nSteer clear, don't waste your money (or your time) here.\n\nFood:          D\nService:      F\nAmbiance:  B+",

I would definitely recommend sharing because they are big portions..Only thing I didn't like was the crappy bowl that it came in...It was too flimsy and hard to eat...Definitely a great spot to come to cure hangovers if you are staying at the Rio..",

  "text": "This is just an awesome little \"hole in the wall\" Mexican restaurant. Their prices are great and their food has that home made taste that many places struggle to capture, but El Cordobes does it with ease.\n\nIf I had to describe this place in one word it would be \"authentic\". Their menu isn't tailored towards Americanized Mexican food like so many other places do. You won't find a salsa bar or queso dip, but you will find tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and things like goat soup.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you'll notice the dining area is very small, just a few booths and some tables in the middle. I wouldn't come here as a large group, as I don't think they would have the staff to handle it even if they had the room. This seems like a place that always has just one cook and one server.\n\nI love the salsa here, though be warned it is a little spicy and they don't have anything milder (like I said, authentic). Funny enough this is they only thing I have had that seem's spicy, though everything is well seasoned. One thing that stand's out about their food is they seem to use less salt than any other Mexican Restaurant I have been to. You don't really notice how salty most Mexican food is until you come to a place like this that doesn't use as much. The lack of salt is actually a good thing, as it let's the natural flavors of the ingredients and seasoning's stand on their own. And heck, you can always add a little salt if you need it (though I have never felt the need here).\n\nI've tried quite a few things on the menu, and I have been impressed with almost everything. I am even more impressed considering their prices are excellent. Almost all their meals are less than $10, and burritos run for $6 or less. The two thing's that just astound me are that they have ceviche tostadas for $1.50 and tacos for $1.25. You can't find prices like that at Mexican fast food, let alone a sit down environment! And they have a ton of meat options for the tacos to; chorizo, asada, pastor, carnitas and chicken just to name a few. My wife and I almost always get a few tacos in addition to our meals every time we come here as they are very good and you just can't beat that price.\n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is anything with shredded beef in it, though I also love their chili verde. To be honest the only thing I ever had here that I didn't like is a torta with breaded steak, and even then the flavor was good it was just really chewy and tough. I also see a lot of people order soups, which I haven't tried myself but smell great and are served in large bowls. The next time we come here I plan on trying one.\n\nOne last thing, they have Mexican sodas and Mexican beers for great prices to. Sodas are $2 and beers are $3. Everything is served in glass bottles, and the coke is even in the larger size than the typical 12 ounce size. Yet another thing that adds to the authenticity of this establishment.\n\nIf you love really good authentic Mexican food, then you really need to give El Cordobes a try. This is one of those places that really stands above most of the rest.",

Be nice if they added a couple T.Vs to catch some football games on. Service was good, drink refills definitely wasn't a problem. Highly recommend!",

  "text": "Great pastrami piled high on rye, just the way we like it!  This place is tucked in a corner off the casino floor which actually makes it even better, away from all the noise and smoke.  Simple and basic but fast and tasty!  Could have used a larger portion of potato salad on the side just to balance the meat out but there was more than enough food.  Another great find with a little help from Yelp reviews!",

Five Star Friday's with Katie and Amy were the hi-light of my week (and date night tradition with the hubs) until my work schedule ended it.  Welcome though to Five Star Saturday morning with Jordan, my new after work spot!  6 am the guys from work and I love to go hang with Jordan and enjoy his exceptional service!  Bored on Saturday night, then Katie and Rich will keep you company (and keep you laughing all night!) And let me just tell you about Sunday morning breakfast with Terri!  She is the sweetest!  Always has our redbulls ready as soon as she see's us and knows my breakfast order by heart!  Can't beat Five Star Tavern on Craig and Rancho!  I fell in love with the place the first time I walked in the door and it's the only place I feel comfortable going by myself!",

  "text": "Before a High Roller ride, my husband & I decided to have a breakfast nearby. We were surprised to see Canter's Deli from our Yelp app. Since we're from LA, we had been to the Fairfax location. \n    At 1st, we were skeptical because of the 2 star rating and the negative reviews. But as  we're in the casino area we took our chances (LOL). And we're grateful that we did. \n    1st win:  Upon entry, we were greeted by a smile as we were seated in a comfortable place. Noticed the cleanliness of this deli, great atmosphere. \n     2nd win: service - Our drinks were served real quick. Our orders came just right on time & were served hot the way that I requested from our server.\n      3rd win: food - OMG. My hubby ordered the pastrami sandwich. I ordered the combo sandwich (pastrami & corned beef) . We added the matzo ball soup. These came with sides of pickles and green tomatoes. The rye bread was soft & fresh. The matzo ball was savory.  The huge serving of pastrami was seriously delicious & melted in our mouths. \n      For the negative price comments: our huge servings relatively covered 2 meals versus 1 meal, not to mention the great taste of our food, clean place and cozy dining area.  Come on, you're in Vegas. I bet everyone else spends more to have fun. Then why not spend on something that satisfies your hunger & gives you a nice dining experience. \n        Canter's - you're now in the list our favorite spot in Vegas.",

But the highlight of the entire visit was our AWSOME server Kelly!!!  She was bright and bubbly and was extremely attentive to our needs!  If you are ever in the neighborhood and want excellent service and fantastic deli sandwiches...make sure to stop in and ASK FOR KELLY!! You won't be sorry! Thanks Canter's!",

The Jack Daniels sliders are so good, and last time I got the spicy chicken sliders to they're also good, the Bacon potato wedges where kind of mushy. Prices are for 4  Jack Daniels sliders $6.00, 4 spicy chicken sliders $6.00 I forgot how many bacon wages you get cause  didn't finish those but those or $6.00 also. I Think happy hour starts at 10 till closing  not sure cause it's always late at night when go there and it is only in the bar Area there's also booths there too where you can sit not just at bar. I will be back next time I'm in town",

  "text": "Chinese Chow\n\nWe were defeating the system as we purchased a mini Heinekin keg @ the on site \"one stop shop\" in the Rio. Beer filled Starbucks cups in hand- we walked around the casino and finally planted our butts @ the food-court like area right next to the sports betting. \n\nPerfect!\n\nBrew, the Lakers game, and a few steps from some grub. I hovered back and forth from the two choices and Mah Jong won (but not by much). A $12 hot dog verses a $12 Chinese food.. take YOUR pick. \n\nHighlights & Low-lights:\n\n*Pricey but think about where you are\n*Ordered the BBQ Pork Soup: The broth wasn't flavorful AT ALL but it's nothing a LOAD of hot and hoisin sauce can't fix\n*Pork itself was good but overly fatty\n*Lines can get long so of course the wait can get lengthy as well\n*Service was middle of the road \n*Lots of condiments out for your taste buds pleasure\n\nYes, I've had WAYYY better Chinese food. Would I go back? Maybe if I were staying in the Rio again and had my fill of Buffet madness. \n\nNot bad but not tooo good either!!",
