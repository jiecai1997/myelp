The only problem I had with my initial order, was that it was delivered half an hour after my requested delivery window. Not really a big deal, still there with plenty of time for me to get to work.\n\nMy most recent order, however, has been a complete nightmare. At 8:15 AM, there was no sign of my delivery, nor was there at 10:15, or at noon. I saw a couple of boxes on my neighbors porch, but I'm not through type and I don't go through other peoples mail. It turns out I should have. Mina finally got back to me, and said that the delivery driver told her that the packages have been delivered. I replied back, that there was nothing on my front porch and that had been home since 6 AM to see nothing delivered eight hours later. She then replied to me and said that her delivery driver returned and confirmed that the boxes were there, this time with a picture. By no coincidence, there was some shuffling outside of my door about five minutes prior but unfortunately I was in the bathroom and couldn't catch the delivery driver in the act. I attempted to call no less than two dozen times, but the number is automated and no one ever actually picks up. So I drove to the address listed on Google and on their website, only to find out that they haven't been there for sometime. Naturally, I have not received a reply by email since I informed Mina of the situation, and I am now left with a weeks worth of spoiled food that is ineligible for return.", "business_id": "9kPbAt95kECBGGi_e5yV0Q", "stars": 1, "date": "2017-09-05", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 1, "user_id": "i6cOMdhHpvkMvy54_Flpyw", "review_id": "zwbXgPCrGb_5SHcII5ncGg", "text": "Ok So I love Little Caesar's =) The prices are great especially when I have a full house on the weekends...

She acted like it was no big deal and like I was being picky. She asked if I wanted another I didn't want to wait another 10 minutes for a drink so I said no. Finally the owner came back to take our order. My mom ordered menudo, I ordered chicken enchiladas. The food came fast (about 10 minutes) my enchiladas were horrible. They were made from chicken scraps including chicken skin and all dark meat not breast at all. Iv never had enchiladas made from anything other than breast, even taco shops use breast meat. I showed the owner, she said they use chicken legs and no skin even though I was holding a piece of skin almost to her face. She said if I wanted breast they had items on the menu with breast. My mother was done with her meal by then. When I told her I didn't want anything she pick up the plate and rolled her eyes and walked away. I would never pay $12 for two enchiladas made from chicken legs. Another 10 minutes went by and still no check. My mom had to go to the register and ask for the check.

Finally I asked what looked like the manager and she told us there was only one register. \n\nThe cashier at this register was training 2 others and he was very nice and friendly.   \n\nThe food we ordered was actually better than I expected!  The corned beef was delicious and I've never had pickled green tomatoes and I thought they were great.  The potato knish had a great flavor but the outside was super tough.   Like I could hardly rip it tough.   If I ate gluten  (the knish totally has gluten and I had hives for it but it was that good inside) I totally would have ordered a bagel because they looked pretty delicious. \n\nOverall I think this place succumbs to typical Vegas Strip chain eating.

I asked why it was on the menu if I wasn't allowed to order it, and the Eat24 rep told me it was an issue with the app (not the restaurant's fault).  Fair enough; I told them I didn't need the wings, and they could remove them from my order.\n\nAn hour later (105 minutes after I placed the order), the food arrived.  I was so eager to dig in at that point, I didn't check if the delivery was complete and accurate.  It wasn't.

I'd be one of the first to say that you're usually not going to find anything truly special on wheels, with a few notable exceptions of course, so I'm not that I'd never heard of them until i saw the lineup of a new weekly food truck event that I was planning to visit. After trying the food, I became very surprised indeed.\n\nThe highlight of their menu of \"Barcelona Inspired Street Food\" (you'll see the words on both sides of the truck) is actually a separate blackboard full of Iberico ham options (Jamon Iberico \"de Bellota\" to boot, which is reputedly the highest qualtiy). The gentleman outside the truck pointed out this menu while I stared pensively at the truck, and the chef went so far as to offer me a sample.\n\nI will admit that I have certainly never had Iberico before, so I have no point of comparison, but the morsel of meat that the chef offered me was the best thinly sliced ham that I have ever had the pleasure to taste - far richer than whatever prosciuttos that I've eaten (laugh at me all you want, but I'm not that well-traveled or experienced). Consequently, I had to order off their Iberico menu, whether or not the pig that this came from actually ingested acorns and only acorns all of its life.\n\nI chose the Flat Bread of Iberico ($12), which was simply the ham draped on a flatbread, with some tomato and olive oil in between. I already waxed poetic about the ham, but the bread was surprisingly good, certainly far better than whatever run-of-the-mill pitas that every Greek place uses. The tomato was a welcome acidic accent, but perhaps slightly overpowering in some bites. Still, I'd definitely suggest ponying up for either this or really any of their other options if they offer what they call Iberico.\n\nI was also hungry enough to order the Barcelona Sausage ($8.50), a non-encased pork sausage in a buttery roll with zucchini sprouts and chimichurri mojo verde. I really have to highlight the awesome roll, which is by far the best bread that I've had from a food truck and certainly one of the better ones if I include brick-and-mortar. They actually source it from local outfit Great Buns Bakery, but whether it's the third-party softness and airiness or the chef's grill treatment, you can't miss their bocatas (aka bocadillos, aka sandwiches) for this reason alone.\n\nThe sausage needed to shine too - heck, it's the namesake - and it indeed had a rich, meaty flavor. It kinda reminded me a bit of bratwurst, actually. The accompaniments are also nice, including some chips (taro?) that were somewhat prone to falling off but still delivered a touch of crunchiness. I'll likely also grab another bocata next time to see what else they have to offer.\n\nBy the way, both portion sizes are what I'd charmingly call \"modest.\" But with food trucks, you're often prone to paying prices not too much lower for food that's certainly inferior. Same for brick-and-mortar places, sometimes. Go for quality over quantity here and then pig out on whatever gut bombs you might find at other trucks at events.\n\nAs food trucks often do, Boqueria Street posts their menu on their various social media pages, as well as their web site (which also has a copy of the menu, sin* Iberico). That's how you'll find them, and you definitely should make the effort to try one of the best food trucks in town and one of the more interesting new food ventures, four-wheeled and four-walled alike.\n\n[*because not everyone learns at least sufficient Spanish to get by, sin = sans = without - capisce?]", "business_id": "xAhB_i6-799TakpGqVplWw", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-03-24", "useful": 8, "cool": 6}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "V-BbqKqO8anwplGRx9Q5aQ", "review_id": "ueqx9hGYHk8OqTSfURDQ9w", "text": "Not sure how to rate since this is Las Vegas but if I visited this place near me it would be 2 stars.\n\nMy meal only cost around $9.00 and could feed two people.

They're sandwiched (appropriately) between TIABI and Sakana in a fairly small strip mall on Maryland Parkway. \n\nMy eyes lit up when I first saw porchetta on the menu photo. It's not a common if at all available pork preparation in this town (or at least as far as Yelp reviews have cataloged it). After I checked with a friend and received confirmation that it's awesome, I beelined there for lunch, finding the place fortunately (for me) not very busy.\n\nAfter seeing the rotisserie at work right behind the counter, with Brussels sprouts and roasted potatoes both filling drip trays below the porchetta, I decided that I should go pick one of those as a side. Fearing a potential food coma, I kept it light by picking the Brussels sprouts ($4), which appropriately came out at the same time as the sandwich. I wouldn't outright call them mushy, but they're on the soft side and had no crunch. Also, the portion on this was a bit modest for the price. At least the Brussels sprouts are subtly tasty, likely owing to the porchetta drippings.\n\nThe owner was offering sample cups of Cilantro Chicken Soup ($5) while people waited for their orders. After tasting it, I almost had to order one to-go. It's balanced in seasoning and thickness, and the chicken was so tender that you don't even have to hear the owner say that the soup is made fresh daily. Plus, the bowl is quite generously sized.\n\nI did bury the lede a bit, and that's the brilliant Porchetta Sandwich ($12). I was worried that the \"French baguette\" bread would be tough if not outright sharp, but it was simply a delicious and chewy container for the goodness within. That treasure starts with awesome porchetta, including juicy pork loin and the crispy skin of the belly, the latter an unparalleled textural experience.

They were very accommodating with WONDERFUL SERVICE! I added one more star!----------------------\n-- I am very disappointed in the horrendous customer service I experienced by every employee I encountered during my visit. I called ahead and ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese. The woman on the phone  kept asking me if I wanted pepperoni on my pizza and I said no thank you. She asked me a couple times but I declined and when I arrived there to pick up my pizza I told her I was picking up an extra cheese cheese pizza for my Grandmother. She said, \"do you mean the pepperoni pizza?\" and I replied, no I did not order pepperoni on my pizza. This employee told me that I did order pepperoni. She then told me that I specifically told her I wanted pepperoni on the pizza. I have never experienced anything like this before- I just told her again that I didn't and I would like a cheese pizza with extra cheese. It was although she was fighting me and told me that I ordered something that I didn't remember ordering. My grandmother doesn't eat pepperoni, and she's 91, so I know that I did not mention anything about pepperoni.  She said something about her phone being unclear or something, walked away from me, and then I guess the manager at the time walked up to me. Again, she said to me, \"I hear you are picking up a pepperoni pizza\" and I told her there must be a mistake and I ordered cheese pizza with extra cheese for my grandmother!\" She also argued with me to tell me that I had ordered pepperoni. I was thinking - how bizarre- because I never spoke to her before and why wouldn't she just want to rectify the situation. At the time I entered the store there were literally between 7-10 people in the little waiting area and a couple people outside. I know they were very busy and I wasn't mad about the mistake-I was just upset the way I was treated. It's like the two employees were telling me that I was wrong. I just told the manager that I would like them to please make me a cheese pizza with extra cheese and I will wait. She said it will be 10 minutes and I said no problem. I was pretty upset because nobody had apologized and instead I felt HUMILIATED in front of a ton of people like I don't know how to order a pizza or that I don't know what I ordered. I asked her what they can do for my inconvenience and she said they would give me free crazy bread. I said thank you. I had to ask for her to do something! It was beyond bizarre. So about 8 or so minutes later one of the many customers in the store told me that he sees my pizza.I went over to him and asked him how he knows that that pizza sitting on a counter in the back was my pizza. He then told me that he heard another employee say \"this is the extra cheese pizza\".He said that it had been sitting there for a minute and that's why he wanted to tell me. I was confused and thought it was very weird, but I hollered into the back area (bc nobody was in front at the counter at the time- also weird because of the amount of people), and a nice new employee brought it to me promptly. I told her that I heard this might be my pizza and she confirmed it. Then I told her that I was given free crazy bread. She asked me for my receipt. I was never given a receipt with my corrected order and I did ask my original person that was working with me that I spoke on the phone- about whether I needed a receipt and she said no. Also the manager said no. So when the woman who brought my pizza asked another employee up front (one who didn't know my story and was new to the situation) she said I need a receipt. I told her I was told by two employees I didn't need one. Then she just walked away and the manager came back. I checked my pizza and it felt colder than usual. I told her that I don't have my receipt because you said I don't need it, but you were going to give me crazy bread for the inconveniences.She grabbed the bread. I told her that I wanted her to know that a gentleman waiting told me about my pizza and how it had been sitting out for a minute. I told her that it was less than 10 minutes and I am ok with this, but I think it's weird that after everything it would be sitting there.Then she proceeded to tell me that it was not true and it was impossible that it was sitting out because she made it. I told her the gentleman saw it and told me and I saw it and had to call someone in the back to bring it to me. She said well that is HIS opinion that it was sitting out there, but that is NOT what happened. I told her why would he make this up, there are a ton of people in here. I told her \"You know what, I wouldn't be upset at all if you guys made a mistake, I had to wait a bit longer, if you just said you were sorry!\"I told her NOBODY during this entire encounter said SORRY!

If your dream sandwich includes beef instead, prepare to be happy with their tender tri-tip. My hubby was made very happy with his choice. Let it be noted that he had to take home the remaining half of his sandwich because #1, we were given samples of their delicious spicy beef broth soup and chicken cilantro rice soup; and #2, we gorged ourselves on their hummazing hummus and hot fried pita triangles, in addition to herb seasoned french fries plus fry sauce (yay, a noteworthy resemblance to yummy Utah Greek diner fry sauces).\n\nThe owner, I believe (Minnesota man who also loves hockey) let us try their frozen, fresh yogurt made today by his wife.  Creamy, tangy and lemony flavored goodness, topped with crushed honey-soaked baklava.  WOW, I would stop in here just for that!  Who am I kidding? I would stop in here for nearly anything on their menu.

The cheese was dried and darkened and the pizza was not hot at all. Very disappointing experience when you can't wait to eat after a long day. Normally this location is good, but they let this one slip through the cracks. \n\nI am a former Little Caesars GM, so I understand how the markings on the box work. Each pizza has a 30 minute shelf time from the moment it comes out of the oven until it expires and needs to be thrown out. They are marked 30 minutes ahead of time so the crew knows when to trash it. My box was marked \"4\" which means it expires when the minute hand reaches the \"4\", or in this case at 8:20. My receipt has a transaction time of 8:32 so this pizza was 42 minutes old and expired by 12 minutes when it was sold. \n\nI understand the want to not have a high nightly waste, and it sucks when you make too many pizzas and nobody buys them. But the answer is not to sell expired pizza to customers, all that will do make us not want to come back. Crew and assistant managers should be retrained on expiration procedures.

Always up for trying a new Chinese restaurant, being that I was in the area, JC Cuisine would be lunch. \n\nWhen I walked inside, I showed the woman at the register the Yelp Check-in offer for a complimentary drink. Going off subject for a sentence, I could create either a Yelp Talk thread or Yelp List on the greatest excuses that businesses give for incompliance with the Yelp Check-in offer. The excuse that the woman representing JC Cuisine gave is that the lunch special excludes the Check-in offer. I'm thinking this is not the end of the world. The bottomless fountain Pepsi is $1.55 or a can is $1. And most of all the Chinese lunch in special is one of the greatest deals around. \n\nJC Cuisine is a full-service Chinese restaurant that also offers take out. With that said, the woman at the cashier walked me to my table. She was friendly. That is a reason that I passed over a star deduction for Check-in offer incompliance. Wearing a friendly attitude she led me to a table in the back of the house that was away from the window. This was on a June afternoon during a heat advisory. From this point on she was my waitress and I was the sole dining patron. \n\nPerusing the lunch special menu, I observed that there is a $5.95 and $6.95 list. The later included shrimp based entrees. Proceeding this review, there is a picture of this very lunch menu. I decided on the pepper steak with onions. At $5.95, it included a bowl of egg drop soup followed by the entr\u00e9e with fried rice, and soft chow mein noodles. Complimenting the waitress filled the glass of bottomless Pepsi. \n\nNow, I will discuss the food. The egg drop soup tasted average. However, there was a tasty touch of corn in the soup. A few minutes later, the waitress delivered the meal. It was a unique presentation. This is the first time that I remember seeing Chinese food presented in a long dish that had three portions. One of the pictures that proceed this review shows the left portion holding fried rice, the center holding pepper steak with onions, and the right portion holding soft chow mein noodles. Working off the fried rice on the left portion, the taste was agreeable. Close by, it was more enjoyable working off the pepper steak with onions. Both of them were tasty and the right temperature. However, when I worked off the soft chow mein noodles on the right side, my taste buds were like, \"This is filler and they've tasted better.\" Immediately I asked the waitress for hot sauce. She pointed to the bottle on the next table. I grabbed it then blanketed the soft chow mein noodles with it. This failed to blanket my opinion of the soft chow mein noodles. They were not warm. Considering that the fried rice and entr\u00e9e were warm it was odd that the chow mein noodles weren't. Are they supposed to be not hot? Fortunately two out of the three items on the plate weren't bad. I agree with Meat Loaf's philosophy that two out of three ain't bad. Then again it ain't great. \n\n  The bill came out to $8.12 before the tip. After paying the bill, I left with the opinion that JC Cuisine is an average Chinese restaurant.", "business_id": "ot1sUqbDrXEd8BELJZw6IA", "stars": 3, "date": "2017-06-18", "useful": 10, "cool": 10}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "ZefNxXRVAPNy7983Rz5J1w", "review_id": "nO6LaxwkZoM47steP95GKw", "text": "The Mac N Cheese is amazing here!

The porchetta is amazing, hearty and juicy with a nice crispy skin for contrast, piled on a hearty artisan roll with arugula, parsley gremolata, and a lemon sauce. It was a fantastic lunch, and I didn't eat for the rest of the day because I was so full.\n\nThe tri-tip sandwich was also tasty, with a heap of caramelized onions and a really great garlic sauce for kick. This paired well with their fries, and again, it was a humongous portion. They have seasonal soups; I preferred the beef over the chicken. Their warm and chewy pita chips are my favorite version I've come across; the $4 portion with creamy hummus is huge enough to be a meal in itself.\n\nBoth visits have treated me to lots of staff interaction, from answering my annoying questions about the food to trying samples of other dishes and getting detailed info about their menu and concept. Everyone here is very friendly and everything is made fresh in house, from the sauces to the breads and everything in between. Looking forward to coming back for their chicken pita next time!\n\nEDIT: Returned for the chicken pita! It was bomb, and so healthy too.

They make everything to order and it can take time, but it's well worth it. \n\nJamon Iberico ($13) - This is some tasty ham! The split-top rolls that they grill in butter really hold the fillings in nicely and tastes great. While I like this sandwich, I actually recommend the quesadilla which is stuffed with iberico ham, mushrooms and mozzarella. \n\nPatatas Bravas ($7) - This is a full portion, but you can add a smaller version for $3 to any meal. The menu describes this as fried potato wedges with Barcelona style spicy sauce. I like the patatas bravas a lot, but the flavor hasn't been consistent each time. Sometimes the sauce it much spicier than other times and even has a different color. \n\nVaca Saltada ($11) - Braised beef, manchego cheese, red onion, spicy yellow chili mayo on a split-top roll grilled in butter and topped with pretty edible flowers. The beef has great flavor and all the fillings compliment each other well. This sandwich was well liked by all in my group that tried it. \n\nCroquetas ($7) - There's chicken inside these fried tasty gems. You get 4 of them in the order and side of Parmesan cheese bechamel for dipping.

Not only was everyone else on their 4th appetizer by the time I received my food, it was not cooked as ordered. My fries were soggy with blood,  and the lobster tail was grilled from the outer layer and raw underneath.

You can place a phone order or walk right up to the counter and order. There is plenty of tables with seating in the food court and the area is usually pretty clean. I have had both the Capastrami and Bobbie from this location several times and it's been constantly tasty. The employees are friendly and I like that they accept the rewards from their app as well coupons that come to my e-mail. Having the app gets you freebies like cookies, drinks and sandwich upgrades as well a free sandwich after purchasing so many. Make sure to check the bottom of your receipt they sometimes have discounts towards your next purchase. This is a decent place to grab a sandwich hot or cold.\n\nCapastrami ($8.49 for a small) - Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw. This is definitely my favorite sandwich at Cap's. The coleslaw is made fresh daily and it just tastes good. I order it to-go often and it's still hot and delicious by the time i get home to eat it. \n\nThe Bobbie ($7.59 for a small) - Homemade Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. It's like they took all the leftovers from Thanksgiving and put it between bread for the ultimate leftover Thanksgiving sandwich. The turkey is made fresh at each location and hand-pulled. I really liked how this last Thanksgiving they had the option to add a side of gravy, score! Where has this gravy been? Please bring the gravy back as a regular menu item because it pairs so nicely with The Bobbie! This is the perfect sandwich to pack for a picnic lunch, hike or to take with you to work for lunch because it holds up well. \n\nThe bread for the Cap's locations here in Vegas and Henderson come locally from Great Buns Bakery and is delivered fresh to each location. \n\nSizes are as follows and it's worth noting because to this day I see people ordering a large and then they get so surprised at how big it is:\n\nLarge - 20 inches\nMedium - 12 inches\nSmall - 9 inches", "business_id": "5TY-YMiAXgBjmP_y4AiXhg", "stars": 4, "date": "2016-12-17", "useful": 50, "cool": 53}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "DGtvmH_K6298j9V5QIAOOA", "review_id": "rA5i4V0hpqjeNrusJrERjQ", "text": "This is the best sushi in town, strip or off.

I had looked forward to Canter's coming to Summerlin. As it turned out, the place is infested with astronomical prices and infinestimal service. My brother was so disgusted by his $20 pastrami sandwich plus $3 for a side dish that he wrote his second Yelp review.\n\nI knew that Canter's was opening a second Las Vegas location on the Strip. In the front of my mind I knew that if a pastrami sandwich is close to $20 in Summerlin, it would be off the charts expensive on the Las Vegas Strip. When all is said and done, I wasn't chomping at the bit for this Canter's to open.\n\nThroughout this week we'd pass through the Linq between the Orleans shuttle stop and the Strip. Near the High Roller on an empty storefront door there was a small sign saying that Canter's is Coming Soon. I was surprised when I was walking in the Linq when my olfactory senses alerted me to Canter's. Only a few hours ago, it was an empty storefront. Canter's had just opened a couple of hours ago. Expecting price shock I asked if there was a take out menu. The friendly lady said they had been open about an hour and that I can take pictures of the menu. I did just that, then outside the Linq evaluated the choices. Astonishingly a pastrami sandwich on the Strip is a few dollars less than the exact one in Summerlin. And astonishingly, this deli does not offer the very popular deli staple: kosher. However, they do offer an egg salad sandwich, which is not too common in Las Vegas. So, I followed my olfactory senses back to the aroma of deli food. Disparite from the majority of the menu, the price for the egg salad sandwich is fair. The egg salad sandwich with the choice of bread (including a bagel) and two sides is $9.25 and a bottomless plastic cup of a Coke product is $3.\n\nThe same friendly employee that greeted me a few minutes previous nicely told me to seat myself. In this large room filled with Canter pictures and a new restaurant scent, I sat myself then waited and waited and waited. I'd even change my seat to the center of this uncrowded newly opened deli. Finally a server asked me what I wanted to drink. A Coke ($3).He'd place the drink on the table then the service disappeared. It seemed that I likewise disappeared. Servers just passed me by. Service was nonexistent. I'd see the staff standing at the entrance of the kitchen. I'd even see a manager seated at a table across from me that failed to acknowledge me. Then there was an employee sweeping that failed to acknowledge me. Nobody offered me a menu, although I assume that I was supposed to take one when I served myself. After approximately twenty minutes of being the invisible man, I preferred to be a visible man and exchange my hard earned money with a waitstaff that acknowledges me.\n\nOn its first day of opening, Canter's does not have a bug to fix. Just common sense! If somebody is seated for twenty minutes without a menu, there is a good chance that he might want somebody to acknowledge him and place a menu on the table so that he could order something. Possibly even a $17 pastrami sandwich. Canter's needs to offer more deli food that reflects on their original location. This includes Kashe. Finally Canter's needs to rethink their pricing strategy.\n\n....................\nReviewer's note: I gave 2 stars instead of 1 optimistic that the Management team will read this review and fix the issues discussed in this review. Las Vegas has a shortage of delis. If Canter's Management addresses these drawbacks it has the potential to provide a much needed good deli in the Las Vegas market.", "business_id": "VSKuaELhYMXOpLql_r4Z0A", "stars": 2, "date": "2017-10-20", "useful": 9, "cool": 7}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "WJjUk1-gib1AD4u-q2VNYA", "review_id": "x-3l8sLj_2hya6lJOKQycA", "text": "Karved is a welcomed addition to the food corner at this Target strip mall by UNLV.

Didn't see any staff right away. Took a couple of minutes before we got greeted. But once we did, very nice. The overall atmosphere was a little dark, but very festive. Both Mexican style and Halloween. \n\nThey brought chips and salsa and a veggie soup. The chips are very fresh, tasted made that day. So tasty too. We both ordered different things, he ordered a carnitas burrito with rice. I ordered the too hard chicken taco plate with rice and beans ($10.50). Not bad prices. Was very pleased with the portion sizes.  The food was quickly brought out and very fresh and we'll made. Great flavors. You can tell they hope to have more people too, set up for events, dancing, sports, big screens. Also have a small bar, margarita's and beer.  \n\nHopefully people will come try their great food.", "business_id": "UNHvM2pc7AQBL22BhakNlA", "stars": 4, "date": "2017-10-20", "useful": 5, "cool": 4}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "1llEOrbw_1K3q5Kxqe2w2w", "review_id": "lTMzhzojTO1JN5XAPPpzjQ", "text": "We were looking for somewhere close to have breakfast and ran across this new restaurant.

Cambray Onions, and Jalapeno Peppers served with Refried Beans and Salad\nShrimp Aguachile with Onions, Cucumber and Lemon\nCarnitas Burrito with Beans, Rice, Lettuce, Tomato, Sour Cream and Red Sauce served with Rice and Salad\nMixed Fajitas with Beef, Shrimp and Chicken served with Guacamole, Pico de Gallo, Refried Beans and Rice\n\nRecently opened at 5795 West Tropicana Avenue, the former location of an Indian Restaurant that has been lightened up and rebranded with a Mexican Menu, it was with friends that dinner was enjoyed on Saturday at Chupy's Mexican Restaurant, the sizable space yet to catch on but likely only due to a lack of advertising as the flavors tend quite authentic with good prices for this style of Cuisine on the West Side.\n\nOwned by a husband and wife couple out of California, the Chef formerly splitting time between four locations on the West Coast before moving his family to Las Vegas, it was just past 7pm that the party of four sat down at a table near the bar where Agua Fresca's are currently made and kept alongside soda, a liquor license yet to arrive but reportedly on the way though apparently tied up by Sin City's lengthy wait list.\n\nRedecorated with backlit Mariachis, character painted walls and old photos of Mexico, the overhead music appropriate and not overly loud with a festive feel, it was shortly after seats were taken that both the restaurant Manager and Chef stopped by to offer their greetings, a laminated menu displaying several plates visually with several dozen choices including choices as traditional as Aguachile and Molcajete all the way to Nachos, Tacos and Fajitas.\n\nCarefully balancing authenticity with broad appeal, the fact that everything save for Desserts are made in house daily speaking of ownership not looking to cut corners in winning over a crowd, it was prior to orders being placed that a large basket of Housemade Tortilla Chips were presented warm alongside Salsa with a medium amount of heat, the quality of both impressive compared to most Off-Strip spots while a complimentary Quesadilla Appetizer was pretty standard stuff, though the toasty Flour Tortilla was quite fluffy despite being pan-seared around Cheese.\n\nNot dissuaded by the lack of Margaritas, though certainly many do come to a Mexican Restaurant with expectations of such, it was instead with Water and two Agua Frescas that the Meal was enjoyed, the uncarbonated Hibiscus Flower version mild like herbal Tea while the pale Tamarind drink was fruity and refreshing between bites including a starting duo of Shrimp and Scallops served in white-hot porcelain with Cheese, Peppers and Onions served alongside the equally sizzling Molcajete filled with a Tomato-based Sauce heavy with Chiles as well as Garlic below a rim ringed in Beef, Shimp, Chicken, Cactus and Cheese.\n\nServing well-seasoned Mexican Rice and scratch-made Refried Beans with most plates, the latter showing a lot of care in terms of texture and flavor with great smoothness and just a touch of Cumin and Salt, it was with the first two plates still being enjoyed that a jumbo Burrito stuffed with Chorizo and all the traditional fixings was served next to Aguachiles so spicy and clean that one may assume that they have crossed the border, the Chef even going so far as to leave the tails on as they do in Mexico City which, although authentic, may come as a surprise to less experienced or unsuspecting diners.\n\nRounding things out with a Mixed Fajita platter, the choice of housemade Corn or Flour Tortillas a nice touch with everything on the sizzling plate meeting the same high standard as those before it, it was after hearing that Desserts were thus far outsourced that the decision was made to end the meal with a bit more of the Burrito, the smoky Red Sauce having at this point penetrated deeply with both the Rice and Meat inside well saturated and all the better for it. \n\n***1/2: Just starting to get up to

When we asked her if she had put our order in for our beer she had the nerve to roll her eyes at us for her mistake! We went for happy hour and we were planning on ordering some more appetizers for our group but she was no where to be found, it's as if she hid for long periods of time waiting for happy hour to end. I try not to judge a server for being slow or even a little forgetful because we all make mistakes including my self, but being rude for your own mistakes is uncalled for. We do appreciate the manager who was working at the time, because he was understanding and he did try fixing the crappy experience she gave us.

Amped up mayo and spreads and fresh veg and micro greens that actually make sense (the flavor of the micro greens adds to the enjoyment of the sandwich).  Proteins, very well chosen and blend well with everything.  The Jamon Serrano, sweet porky goodness and cured funk that pairs well with the mushrooms.  The Botifarra; naturally cased, coarse ground seasoned pork; delicious and fatty, intensified by a great chimichurri mojo verde.  Finally the vaca saltada; braised beef with manchego cheese and an earthy chili mayo, just plain good eats.\n\nDo try an order of patas bravas (deep fried thick potato wedges with a spicy aioli).  Fluffy on the inside, gently crisp on the outside, it makes a perfect, rich side to any sandwich.\n\nNote: If you have not tried Iberico ham from black footed, acorn fed pigs, AND it's on offer here, go for it.

The place is simply decorated with orange walls, orange and black drapes with a wood floor that could be converted to a club with a full bar, DJ'ing area and dance lights. \nI'm not sure of most of the names since they are in Serbian. Our waitress suggested for a appetizer the \"Cheese Pie\" a pastry wrapped around cheese similar to mozzarella. For a salad we split a salad made of tomatoes, cucumbers and feta cheese. Finally for entrees, I had the Mixed Meat Derbi plate, which was basically a sample plate of the grilled meats available (sausage link, pork chop, pork loin and a beef patty over fries) and my cousin got the Big German Hamburger (a Beef patty stuffed with cheese on a Serb style bun). Both were good but I found the flavor lacking, kinda bland. I guess they don't heavily season their foods. Interesting thing was the hamburger bun, it had a light texture and the flavor was sweet similar to a pancake, hard to pinpoint. \n My major dislike of the place is the all the smoking going on inside, a true smokers den.

The space was previously occupied by an Indian restaurant that for better or worse, didn't last long. Previous to that was another ethnic restaurant that suffered the same fate. That's the reason why I bring it up: it's a really nice space that actually looks as if it has much more potential than just a hole-in-the-wall place to grab a lunch. I hope the owners continue improving the overall look of the place, as I want this place to stick around a while, especially since it's proven to be a space with a bit of a jinx. \n\nThe food is where things turn everything else on it's head. The chips and salsa are both freshly made, and you can tell. Next, they actually bring you a small bowl of soup (akin to vegetable beef I'd say.) I'll get back to that soup later. \n\nThe main courses I've had have all been really good. There are bright flavors to be had in nearly every bite. The carnitas are pure porky paradise, and aren't the dry mouthful of sand that are often served elsewhere; sad, unfortunate victims of sitting too long. *sniffle* What a waste! Luckily, Chupy's respects the ingredients they use, and serve them up right. The flavor adventure is quite obviously guided by an authentic, experienced hand -- it tastes as if you were invited over to someone's home for a meal. It's then that you forgive the surroundings, because you know you've found something true; something special. In some ways, you almost want it to be your own little secret. Unfortunately, the history of the space won't allow that. \n\nThe first time at Chupy's, a night shortly after they opened, was funny. It took around ten minutes to be noticed for seating, despite there only being one other party in the entire dining room. The previously mentioned soup had stars for noodles. There was a bar with no alcohol. Now, the soup is served as if it's actually meant for adults. Service is quick, and personable. They serve alcohol. The food remains as good as always. Chupy's continues to make changes as it gains it's sea legs in a tough location. If you're a fan of great Mexican food served with care and attention, I implore you to do your part to help a family owned local business stay open.

We travel to the East side of Las Vegas and boy did I have a hankering for something special, home style and humble. I remember a long time as a young teenager that after going to Broadacres swap meet we ended up finding a Tejuino vendor and if you don't know what this is, it's a flavorful punch in the mouth of a drink from Jalisco, Mexico. \n\nAfter falling in love with this drink for it's flavorful and tangy taste, I quickly  realized that \"Tejuino\" was not widely available among traditional Mexican restaurants that Toni and I visited. I was on a mission, something special maybe a sit down place, maybe something that could satisfy. I had to find it. \n\nWhen searching, even google had a hard time searching for anything besides odd street vendor listings, which is amazing because back in the day, street vendors didn't even know what GPS was let along reviews. But good on em' for at least being listed but this wasn't what I was looking. \n\nAfter calling my father to see if he remembered a restaurant or sit down spot, he quickly directed me to \"La Reyna\". I was skeptical because not only did he know of a restaurant that specializes in Jalisco style Tejuino, he beet out Google and even gave me an address. So Toni and I were in a mission, and into my Ford Focus we went.\n\nNow, I need anyone reading this to look past the location because I was not familiar with it and when I found it, it was not in a spot that I felt gave this place any credit. You will find a Market, some small style shops and La Reina last from the L-shape shopping lineup. But it was a diamond in the rough...\n\nWalking in, it was a completely different atmosphere. Walls were lined with authentic Mexican film memorabilia and classic Mexican posters. The tables were somewhat clean on the top but had some sticky touch on the crease of the walls and some on the drink specials. Toni also picked up a small smudge on her finger from under the table and we didn't know what it was, napkins at the table would have been a good idea specifically for this. The soccer game that day was playing on the TV loud enough to hear the announcers but low enough to enjoy a conversation from any seating place in the building. \n\nAs always, I had to take a look at the restrooms just to see if this was all a mirage but clean in the men's, will have to assume for the women's bathroom, sorry. We sat on the booth seats together facing the TV and was quickly greeted by an older lady that reminded me of my own family and was quickly transported to my grandmother's house. \n\nI quickly asked if they served Tejuino and she said that majical word, \"Si, Como no?\". Toni not understanding the magic, she quickly ordered a Coke, she didn't know what we were into. Once we received the menu, most had names and pictures which is my favorite type. Everything looked delicious and a combination of what I would get at my mother's/grandmother's house celebrating a family get together. \n\nToni chose her tried and true Chicken Fajitas and I ventured into unknown territory with the \"Mar I Tiera\" plate. Toni's chicken fajitas had a traditional plate of shredded lettus with dressing, authentic beans with crumbled \"queso fresco\" on top and some rice along with the delicious rotisery chicken and veggie slices. At one point, a fly was buzzing around and due to randomness, it fell into Toni's coke. The older lady quickly brought a replacement coke but I thought they could use an industrial fly catcher to fix that problem completely. Toni doesn't impress easily, but she chowed down on her plate and said it was really good, which to me is one of the higher compliments you could get out of Toni. \n\nToni also had bits off of my plate which came with the same salad, beans, rice combo but with carne asada, sauteed shrimp and veggies. I am very picky about my rice and beans but the entire time I could only think about the dedication and time it takes to get large amounts of rice and beans exactly to the quality I received that day.\n\nOf course, while there, I only saw the older lady, and heard no one else having conversations in the back around the kitchen. I didn't know if they had a cook or another employee but it felt as though it was just the older lady, Toni amd myself. We might have been there in a slow time, but this place was empty and for what I just had, it didn't reflect the crowd to quality ratio in my opinion. \n\nAt the end of it all, I had two large mugs of Tejuino and as I was paying our bill which was fair for what we had, I ordered a Tejuino to go. Knowing that it was going to be a long time before I would be to the east side of Las Vegas and enjoy the restaurant again from La Reyna but I knew it was worth the trip for the awesome food we had.\n\nIf you want to try or get Tejuino and equally great authentic dishes from Mexico, I recommend La Reyna.

One of the staff (possibly the owner?) walked me through the steps it took to create this flavorful masterpiece.  Totaling a three to four hour process, pork tenderloin is first rolled inside pork belly, then cooked rotisserie-style, and sliced up into juicy, tender pieces.  These are tossed into a fresh, chewy baguette slathered with a lemon caper gremolata spread and some greens.   If that isn't enough, pork cracklins are tossed over the sandwich to add a nice crunch to the mix.  It's just a burst full of flavor and truly makes this one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.\n\nMy wife and I also enjoyed the combo Peruvian Chicken and Beef tri-tip combo platter with potatoes, rice, and brussel sprouts on the side.

How long does it take to cook 3 meals when the place is dead?! They finally bring out out and guess what, there's seasoning on it. Due to having a sensitive stomach seasoning is out of the question. Sent it back are the rest of the meal and another 20 minutes go by and they finally being another steak. Guess what they did, rinsed it off and threw it back on the grill. It was obvious as underneath there was still some seasoning underneath. The steak was now burned not the medium well that was ordered it was well done and burned. When the manager was questioned why there was still seasoning he lied and said there wasn't even thought it was in the juice on the plate and in the napkin that I dabbed it with. \n\nAlso another order was the jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. On the menu it said a full rack of ribs. They brought out a 1/2 rack. I questioned the server and he said they only do 1/2.

The nigiri is just sitting there while waving and attempting to flag down anyone working.  15+ minutes with no service at an AYCE is terrible.  Empty waters, no service, nothing to eat our sushi with.  Meanwhile the party at the bar continues with the chefs doing shots with friends at the bar.  Our maybe waiter who greeted and sat us was polite and running around trying to keep up with the 4-5 other tables, but continued to avoid us even after saying he would be \"right back\" 15 or so minutes after we flagged him down. \n\nBottom line, this place needs to get their game together if they want to stay open.

Why chinese food? I have this theory that the greasy the food the better the alcky doesnt soak in your stomach. haha! The first night we got there we were in a rush to head out to XS, so we stopped down here since we were staying at the Rio. \n\nThe prices for the dishes range around 10-12 dollars for the main dishes. You might think these prices are steep but its family style and the portions are pretty big! We had the general chicken which came with a bowl of rice, and chow fun. Everything was nicely cooked and not over seasoned which I came to the conclusion that there probably wasnt MSG in the meal which is always a bonus. They have a full stock of condomints: soy sauce, sriracha, garlic chili sauce, hot mustard, sweet sour sauce and many more. I also liked that the cooks in the back were old chinese guys so you know the food has to be sorta legit hahaha.  The last night there we had the food again, this time me and my gf split the hot and sour soup and the Singapore noodles.

Their prices are great and their food has that home made taste that many places struggle to capture, but El Cordobes does it with ease.\n\nIf I had to describe this place in one word it would be \"authentic\". Their menu isn't tailored towards Americanized Mexican food like so many other places do. You won't find a salsa bar or queso dip, but you will find tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and things like goat soup.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you'll notice the dining area is very small, just a few booths and some tables in the middle. I wouldn't come here as a large group, as I don't think they would have the staff to handle it even if they had the room. This seems like a place that always has just one cook and one server.\n\nI love the salsa here, though be warned it is a little spicy and they don't have anything milder (like I said, authentic). Funny enough this is they only thing I have had that seem's spicy, though everything is well seasoned. One thing that stand's out about their food is they seem to use less salt than any other Mexican Restaurant I have been to. You don't really notice how salty most Mexican food is until you come to a place like this that doesn't use as much. The lack of salt is actually a good thing, as it let's the natural flavors of the ingredients and seasoning's stand on their own. And heck, you can always add a little salt if you need it (though I have never felt the need here).\n\nI've tried quite a few things on the menu, and I have been impressed with almost everything. I am even more impressed considering their prices are excellent. Almost all their meals are less than $10, and burritos run for $6 or less. The two thing's that just astound me are that they have ceviche tostadas for $1.50 and tacos for $1.25. You can't find prices like that at Mexican fast food, let alone a sit down environment! And they have a ton of meat options for the tacos to; chorizo, asada, pastor, carnitas and chicken just to name a few. My wife and I almost always get a few tacos in addition to our meals every time we come here as they are very good and you just can't beat that price.\n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is anything with shredded beef in it, though I also love their chili verde. To be honest the only thing I ever had here that I didn't like is a torta with breaded steak, and even then the flavor was good it was just really chewy and tough. I also see a lot of people order soups, which I haven't tried myself but smell great and are served in large bowls. The next time we come here I plan on trying one.\n\nOne last thing, they have Mexican sodas and Mexican beers for great prices to. Sodas are $2 and beers are $3. Everything is served in glass bottles, and the coke is even in the larger size than the typical 12 ounce size. Yet another thing that adds to the authenticity of this establishment.\n\nIf you love really good authentic Mexican food, then you really need to give El Cordobes a try. This is one of those places that really stands above most of the rest.", "business_id": "ifkCEpYaSAUT3WVQNxwvXA", "stars": 5, "date": "2017-07-27", "useful": 0, "cool": 0}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "MiLQJdU2yUuC1Nm54PJioA", "review_id": "mpo0SwhsacaQZDAeGyHDNg", "text": "This place is amazing!

Specifically, I have had the Raiders Roll and the Miss Monica Roll, which were both phenomenal. As well as garlic tuna and yellowtail nigiri which both melted in my mouth, it was so good! \n\nSushi chef and owner Nico does a great job interacting with his customers and delivering quality fresh fish that he personally picks up and checks out everyday. His attention to detail and the amount of flavor he has in each of his roles is insane! You can tell he is all about quality control and only serves the best. \n\nAlso, don't let the yelp reviews fool you. The first week we went in this place was slammed, and everyone appeared happy and satisfied. There's something up with yelp because a couple of months ago this place had 4.5 deserved stars and I checked back recently to see they have removed majority of those for some reason. So what's up with that yelp?! \n\nRegardless, I hope future customers come to enjoy the deliciousness that is Sushi Wabi!

Absolutely ridiculous and they are handing everyone else there food but me. There's no reason for this wait and I will not be coming back.

The Jack Daniels sliders are so good, and last time I got the spicy chicken sliders to they're also good, the Bacon potato wedges where kind of mushy. Prices are for 4  Jack Daniels sliders $6.00, 4 spicy chicken sliders $6.00 I forgot how many bacon wages you get cause  didn't finish those but those or $6.00 also. I Think happy hour starts at 10 till closing  not sure cause it's always late at night when go there and it is only in the bar Area there's also booths there too where you can sit not just at bar.

Beer filled Starbucks cups in hand- we walked around the casino and finally planted our butts @ the food-court like area right next to the sports betting. \n\nPerfect!\n\nBrew, the Lakers game, and a few steps from some grub. I hovered back and forth from the two choices and Mah Jong won (but not by much). A $12 hot dog verses a $12 Chinese food.. take YOUR pick. \n\nHighlights & Low-lights:\n\n*Pricey but think about where you are\n*Ordered the BBQ Pork Soup: The broth wasn't flavorful AT ALL but it's nothing a LOAD of hot and hoisin sauce can't fix\n*Pork itself was good but overly fatty\n*Lines can get long so of course the wait can get lengthy as well\n*Service was middle of the road \n*Lots of condiments out for your taste buds pleasure\n\nYes, I've had WAYYY better Chinese food. Would I go back? Maybe if I were staying in the Rio again and had my fill of Buffet madness. \n\nNot bad but not tooo good either!!", "business_id": "eHgxuooEDnjsmmckxPcKHQ", "stars": 2, "date": "2011-04-07", "useful": 11, "cool": 5}]
