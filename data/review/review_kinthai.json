Since some of us had been to Lucki and to Table Thai, we decided on Kinthai as a new experience to all.\n\nLocation - East Sahara and Valley View, about one block past Weera Thai.  Some decent parking. Always an interesting area, that East Sahara strip malls.\n\nThe Restaurant - Nicely decorated, about 10 booths and about 5-6 tables. Spacious and plenty of room.  They can accommodate groups of most size and if you have a large group, it can be quite good for that!\n\nThe Service - Seems family owned.  The owner or gentlemen that comes out to greet you seems to be very concerned about quality and style of his restaurant.  We were well into our conversation with our friends, so I did not engage with the owner as I normally would.  He came by several times to check on us, and that was great. We just did not speak too much with him as we were catching up with friends.\n\nThe Food -\n\nTom Yum Chicken - Spice 5.  I wanted to go higher, to 7 or 8 but we had a mixed crowd.  All the soups seem to have a shrimp base, and one of our friends cannot eat shellfish.  However, my wife who doesn't like spice at all thought the soup was the best compared to her other favorite places. I thought that the soup had the right amount of kick to at least feel the heat and so i was happy.  Very excellent soup, comes out in a metal soup hotpot with the flames blasting through the top. Just the way i like it.\n\nPad Kee Mao - This was good but hardly spicy.  Normally a spicy dish itself, due to most of our friends not wanting spice, we ordered this at a level 2 spice out of 10 and it was good, just that I needed a bit of a kick in the spice and didn't feel it.  We had this with beef and the beef was tender. The noodles were good, but a bit clumped together.\n\nMassaman Curry - With Chicken, spice level 2, good, rich creamy yellow curry with peanut, I thought it was very good overall.\n\nBasil - With ground pork. again spice level 2.  Good overall, lots of meat, not too much basil.   I would order again or ask more questions like if they have eggplant and such.\n\nSteamed Whole Fish - Not bad, liked the fish, bones and head came off quite easy and everyone enjoyed it. I tend to like steamed fish to be very juicy with lots of juice, soy sauce a bit of oil.  This was  a bit drier than I am used to but I did like it overall and I really enjoyed the amount of ginger they give you.  Of course I prepped the serving by deboning the fish and removing the head and I used my plate for all this so I can clean up the bones and the head of the meat which to me is the best part!\n\nLoved the attention, enjoyed the menu, the ambiance, the flavors. Totally enjoyed the soup.  Would it be my most favorite Thai place? That will depend because tonight, we are going to Lucki Thai and will let you know!", "business_id": "u29lf2yPd-qK5ThAS9FRQQ", "stars": 3, "date": "2016-04-03", "useful": 4, "cool": 2}, {"funny": 0, "user_id": "JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA", "review_id": "8UdvQbHmvg_d0xLB2eJhBg", "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.\n\nNothing bad to say about Kinthai, I just have to compare it with the plethora of other Thai restaurants in the city and it wasn't in my top 5.  \n\nMy meal was tasty, spicy, and very fairly priced.  I had the stir fry with pork and the larb salad.  I got mine extra spicy, and it sure was.  They do a 1-10 sliding scale; I got an 8 and it was an eye rinser - delicious and deadly.

Everything was really clean and new with the restaurant being less than three months old.\n\nMy meal started off with the owner approaching us and introducing himself to us, Ken. He talked with us and let us know that everything was made in house. The recipes they used are traditional and after tasting them, you can tell it is different than most other Thai places. Ken recommended to us trying the fish cakes and chicken wings. The fish cakes had a slight crisp on the outside and a chewy inside. The chicken wings were marinated overnight with their own recipe and had the fried outer layer and a nice tender inside. After came out main dishes. I ordered the panang curry and the rest of my party ordered pad thai. The panang curry was really good. It was a bit sweet and had a nice strong curry flavor that was aided by the coconut milk. The pad thai was good as well, but different than most commercial Thai places. The fried egg roll and dumpling that came with the the lunch special were fried to perfection and were nice and crispy on the outside, with a soft inside. After out lunch, we had dessert, a chocolate cake. Ken let us know that all the desserts are made in house by his wife since his wife has a baking background. The chocolate cake was absolutely delicious. To say the least, it was a great ending to our lunch. \n\nI enjoyed my meal quite a bit here, along with talking to Ken.
