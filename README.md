## About

A few peers and I developed a Flask web-app that uses NLP to generate sentiment based ratings for existing Yelp reviews and custom user-input text.

MYelp includes category-specific ratings broken down by food, ambiance, price and service. The ratings are applied both to real restaurant reviews (provided by the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)), as well as custom reviews that users can input within the web-app.
