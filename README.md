# yelp-review-challenge

Can't upload filtered restaurants to GitHub because the file to filter and the resulting file are too large, so add yelp_business.csv from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/data) to the data_sample folder and then run the filter_businesses.py script to get restaurant csv file.
