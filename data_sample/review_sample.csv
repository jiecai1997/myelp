Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. \n\nThe food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \n\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.","ACFtxLv8pGrrxMm6EgjreA","4","2016-05-28","0","0"

However, the flowers that were delivered was not what he had ordered. He had placed in an order for long stem roses, mixed with orchids and was charged for that. What had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament, not really Valentine's Day flowers. \n\nIn speaking with another friend, something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for Valentine's Day while he was in Germany as a surprise and they never showed up. So when he called them to complaint, they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers. Which she didn't, so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place.\n\nUnderstanding that Valentine's Day is the most busiest day for florists and mistakes do happen, the way they had handled it was not what would have been expected from a florist of that nature.","13nKUHH-uEUXVZylgxchPA","1","2011-02-16","9","1"

So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of cheese. \n\nFor a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of grass jelly and pudding, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).\n\nThe service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.\n\nWe had ordered the following:\n- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)\n- peach ice tea\n- roasted oolong milk tea\n- supernova kumquat lemonade\n\nAnd when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the kumquat lemonade, they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. \n\nThe mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea. The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all.\n\nI guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.\n\nAlso - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks, which were intriguing to us, but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home...\n\nWe will definitely not be returning...","l1_S1mfGbEMxfT1f9omhEA","1","2017-10-16","0","0"

At first, I wasn't impress that it was a 45 mins wait, however my BF really wanted to try this piece, so we decided to wait.\n\nIt was definitely different and worth the wait. \n\nWe started off with the House Cured Meat - it was good - but definitely too much for just 2 people to share (and no need to order the extra bread if it's only two people).\n\nNext came the roasted bone marrow - which is amazing and definitely worth ordering. Had we not ordered so many other dishes, we would have ordered a second round of this. Who knew bone marrow could be this tasty!!\n\nThen came the Spicy Horse Tartare, which we thought was intriguing, as we have never heard, so we had ordered it. When it showed up, it was like a salad. Wasn't bad, worth trying but probably only a one-time thing for us.\n\nTongue on Brioche is definitely another worth ordering. it is a sandwich that tasted like a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.\n\nFor dessert, we had ordered the Foie and Nutella, as we thought this was very interesting. It was good, but after 4 dishes already, this was just a little too rich. It came with banana bread that was really good.\n\nOverall, definitely worth the try!

Even faster when you speak chinese to them.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had ordered the soup dumplings, sweet and sour veggie pork noodle and a beef noodle. The soup dumplings were good, as they are made on the spot. The veggie pork handmade noodle was really good.

It had just opened when I started going and I walked in off the street because I figured I'd take a chance, it looked clean and it was close to home. \nI was greeted by the owner, a pleasant Chinese woman, who did my nails that day. Since then, I've been back at least once a month for manicures and pedicures. Those are the only things I've had done, but I would suspect that the other services are pretty good as well. \nThe spa is new and everything is spacious and clean. They have massaging chairs for pedicures and the prices are reasonable. \nIt's a basic nail place, so the bells and whistles are not numerous, but that suits me fine because it keeps the price down, allows for walk-ins and gets you in and out pretty quickly. \nSome of the ladies in the salon do a better job than others, but no one does a bad job. I have had plenty of bad manicures before, so I know what a bad job looks like. Just don't go expecting someone to fuss over you, or give you plenty of conversation. English is not the first language and I have never felt the need to force conversation. \nIn this past year I have noticed a huge increase in the number of people that go to this spa, so they seem to be doing quite well. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for service though and I'm happier they are busy because it means they are doing well and will stay in business. Good for them AND for me! \nSome of the services they give include manicures, pedicures, gel nails, waxing, threading, eyebrow tinting and ear candles.","5-Gs-cUI_8-3Ykl9KbCLsw","4","2011-05-06","15","5"

Bland food, overcooked, sometimes burnt (nachos). As a result, I haven't bothered going or ordering from there in well over a year. Well, today I had a craving for Mexican and since Toronto has a huge lack of Mexican restaurant choices and because I'm busy working at home, my husband and myself decided to order from BarBurrito's delivery. I should also mention that if you go to justeat.ca BarBurrito charges $7 delivery. Orderit.ca has no charge. Don't know if that's the ordering website or the restaurant, but it's a tip for anyone who decides to order from this place.\n\nSo I went ahead and placed the order...only to have it be ""rejected"" by BarBurrito, because they are busy right now. This restaurant is listed on two different food ordering sites, but they won't deliver if they don't feel inclined?? SERIOUSLY! \n\nSo I have learned my lesson. Don't give places second, or even third chances. And this place...don't even give it a first chance. Not worth it at ALL.","uN2oZDJGO078ExbbV_DGmA","1","2012-06-03","2","0"

But the fact is, I've eaten here twice and neither time was spectacular. \n\nMy expectations of a breakfast place are cheap prices, good food (because eggs are hard to mess up), fast turnover and service. This place has prices on the high end of breakfast place, on weekends they are very crowded and it will take some time to be seated and the food is alright. \n\nThe last time I went, I was with my husband and we went in the door to a huge crowd. There was no wait to be seated sign, but we guessed correctly and waited. Problem is that you pay and wait in the same place, which meant people were coming and going in a very small area. It was chaos for awhile. Finally we were seated outside at a picnic table and told that other people may be seated with us at the table, because they lacked space. \n\nThe waitress took some time to arrive and by then we were ready to give our order. I ordered eggs and bacon and toast. We also each ordered fruit smoothies. I asked for mine without banana. The waitress came back a few minutes later and said with a straight face, ""The guys back there put like three bananas in your smoothie!"" \n\nIt took me a minute to realize she was joking....heh....\n\nWe played several rounds of Scrabble on an iphone because the food was taking quite awhile and it finally came out. Our drinks were no where to be seen. We had to ask twice for them. By then we were almost done the food!\n\nThe food was alright, but I usually go to places like Egg Smart and for the cost, they give you way more food, for a better price and honestly, I think it tastes way better. These famous ""Boom frites"" are just thick, cut potatoes and they give you one slice of toast! \n\nAnyway, if you're in the area and really want some breakfast, it's not terrible, but I think you can do way better! \n\nOh, and I disagree that it's a good place for a group.

I guess my only criticism is that they need more seating. Both times I've been we got lucky and managed to snag seats as someone was leaving, but it's gross out on the street and this summer anyway, it's been SO hot outside.

I have had so many bad experiences at this place, I just need to give up on it. \n\nA few years ago, Sheppard Centre was an alright place. When I lived at Yonge and Sheppard, there was a grocery store across the street and all the basics you would need st Sheppard Centre and it was good. \n\nSheppard Centre is at a major subway stop, in a hugely busy area, but somehow stores keep failing here. \n\nThat being the case, there are a few stores that are nice and handy. I would consider this mall for errands, now that I live away...except that the major reason for coming is gone now.\n\nSheppard Centre used to have 1 hour of free parking, which is a huge draw. You could go and park, run in and pick up your mail, or something from Shoppers Drug Mart and be on your way. They got rid of that. Not only that, but it's $3.50 for half an hour or under!\n\nI think this is pretty pathetic for a crappy mall. \n\n""OH, but they have to pay for their excellent staff!"" you say?\n\nYeah, let me tell you about the staff that work there. First of all, you should also know that the ticket machine to pay for your parking tickets likes to break down ALL THE TIME, so you have to go to the parking garage and drive up to the ticket booth, park in the non-parking spots, block traffic and go in and pay the guys sitting around in the office...an office with TV screens of the parking garage, where our car has been broken into before...but it's not their fault. There are SIGNS that say they are not liable. Soooo...what are the TV screens for? To WATCH peoples' cars get broken into and laugh?\n\nRight, so back to the story! \n\nBefore I knew what to do when the machines broke down, I went to the in-mall security/info booth to ask. The guy was behind the booth, on the phone, having a personal conversation. He saw me, but turned away and continued for ten minutes. Finally he got off the phone and made like he was coming over...only to turn away at the last second and start going through some papers. Finally I called out and said, ""Excuse me?"" He told me he was busy and made a point of moving towards me as slowly as possible.\n\nThis isn't the only time a staff member has been rude to me before. Dogs are allowed in the subway, so I was walking through once, to the subway entrance, HOLDING my dog, in my arms and a security guard chased me down to tell me dogs are not allowed. I told him I was just heading to the subway, so he followed me there to make sure. Yeah, because I really wanted to take my dog to the dollarstore and was clearly lying. GO STOP PEOPLE FROM BREAKING INTO CARS! \n\nBayview Village, down the street, or one subway stop over, has a Shoppers, a grocery store, a post office, a Blacks photography and clothing stores...like Sheppard Centre. It also has a Chapters with a Starbucks, an LCBO, GOOD restaurants and the people there are polite, the bathrooms nicer than mine at home AND parking is free.\n\nSo basically Sheppard Centre can bite me. I'm done with them.","OwYElCdiJ1IGKVJ4--_mvQ","1","2012-12-04","11","3"
"1","nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ","PRj0OFgJjN5ljpeDskP_Tw","Okay, so from what I am reading, a lot of other people got sort of ""conned"" into this hotel and I am no exception. We booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels. The default booking is for Circus Circus, NOT Circus, Circus Manor Motor Lodge. It says three stars and even says this on gate1's travel site: ""The rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings. All rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant, such as internet access (surcharge), a hair dryer, and a television with cable channels.""\nWe looked up Circus Circus, saw it was nothing special, but alright and went for it...and found out that in fact, we were in the Manor Motor Lodge.\nNow, I KNOW that this is gate1's fault and I'll be taking it up with them as well. Also, I want to point out that on my second night, I complained and they put us in a suite for the night, so this is nothing against the overall hotel, but there are still a few things people need to know staying here.\nRooms: They are DUMPS in the manor motor lodge. I asked, when we were checking in, if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that ""all the rooms have been updated in SOME way""...well I don't know what way this room had been updated. The carpets were worn and stained. The bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s. The wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls. The bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned. It looked like a motel room you see in horror movies!\nThe hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana, with cheap, apple air freshener over top, which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families. I even made a joke with a cab driver in Las Vegas, that we were NOT ugly enough to be staying in this hotel. He agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip. Good to know.\n\nHotel: The hotel amenities are geared towards children, but are basically a money grab. There is a small, indoor amusement park that costs something like $8/30 second ride. There are shops and restaurants, but non are high end. We ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy. I'll give those individual ratings though.\n\nService: This was very good actually. I had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom I complained to was very receptive and polite, so that earns them an extra star.\n\nThe thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in, fall under 3 stars, even though they, by themselves, would barely qualify as 1 star rooms, because the whole hotel falls under one heading.\n\nSO, lesson to be learned, these rooms are NOT nice rooms. The hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels. It's also quite far from the main strip. BUT it is cheap. If you are (for whatever God-awful reason) bringing children to Vegas, I guess this would fit the bill. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a bed and a cheap one, this also fits the bill. The beds, I will say, had clean sheets and were comfortable. But don't be fooled into thinking you're getting this amazing deal on a three star hotel. You're not. You're getting an average deal, on 1 star accommodations.","6Q7-wkCPc1KF75jZLOTcMw","2","2012-08-22","3","1"

It's literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been. We finally decided to go for it!\n\nThe atmosphere is fine. It's nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside. The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures. \n\nService was very good. The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. \n\nNow to the food. My husband ordered the veal parm and I ordered a pasta with chicken. We ordered brushetta as a starter. I noticed from the menu that, while a lot of selection, many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired. A lot of very basic dishes. Pasta with mushrooms and red sauce, or pasta with shrimp and pesto, etc. I really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when I go to an Italian restaurant, because quite honestly, I can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.\n\nThat said, the pasta dishes were solid, if nothing special. My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish. My husband's was basic, but veal parms usually are. He did note that there was a LOT of sauce on his. There was, but I like that personally, if there is bread to dip into it...but no bread was served to our table, other than the bread from our brushetta. \n\nThe brushetta wasn't great. The tomato mixture on top was good, but the bread wasn't properly toasted, so it got soggy and couldn't hold its shape. It kept falling apart when you picked it up. \n\nThe desserts really brought this place back for me. I had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent. On the menu it tells you which are made in-house and I would highly recommend getting one of those. \n\nOverall, it was quite expensive for pretty basic Italian food, so it didn't stun me. I'm not opposed to going back, but it's not my first choice. My major reason for going back will be for convenience, because it is so close to us.","NUHNLaMg7aMesMdAiie73w","3","2013-03-29","0","0"

It was much more akin to ice cream and the flavour selection wasn't huge. \n\nThat said, they have some interesting flavours. I personally tried Twix and birthday cake and they were both very good. The more traditional flavour I tried (creme caramel) was a little boring and lacked flavour. \n\nMy husband had the strawberry, Skor and chocolate. All fine, none blew me away.\n\nOkay, so the gelato is good, if not the ""best""! But perhaps that's being picky. If I'm in the area and want some dessert, this place is great and I can imagine in the summer it's fantastic.\n\nSo why the three stars?? First of all you can only get gelato in two sizes - regular and large. There is no small option and both of those options are quite large. If you only want a taste of gelato, there is no option for you! \n\nSecondly, although this place is named for it's gelato, it also specializes in cupcakes. We got a cupcake to bring home. When asked if we would like it packaged to bring home we said yes...and they threw it in a bag. The girl apologized and said they had nothing appropriate to package it in. Why did you offer then?? But furthermore, YES YOU DO! You literally have perfectly shaped round cups to put gelato in everywhere! Guess what shape cupcakes are??\n\nOh well, no biggie.\n\nSo, since this place is about the gelato and the cupcakes, you may be interested in the cupcakes...well the taste was overall good, but it was a very oily cupcake. The icing especially. The cake was moist, which is good...except it was SO moist the cake was just falling apart everywhere! \n\nSo what's the final synopsis. This place isn't bad. It has some delicious options. But nothing is perfect and in fact there are a number of flaws, which prevent me from giving it a better score. We'll see how I feel if it's a boiling hot summer day and I go in there for gelato though...I may be singing a different tune!","ghWwqlRd1MaWz8hfgZ8Vsw","3","2013-04-07","2","0"

I brought it back, with the receipt, but was informed that I couldn't exchange it, because it was on the bracelet. \nI explained that it had been put there BY an employee. The manager was brought out and she was immediately snarky and rude towards me. She said she wouldn't accept a charm that was ""all worn and beat up"". I encouraged her to look at the charm. She could clearly see it was in pristine condition. She glanced at my bracelet as a whole, but did not look at the charm, instead insisting that she could tell.\n\nSeriously lady, you don't stand by your product at all?

The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland ""bun"". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)\n\nThe noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. \n\nI liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this. No graceful way to go about that!\n\nTo be honest, this place just didn't blow me away enough to make a conscious effort to return. It certainly wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really good either.","zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ","2","2013-10-19","2","0"

Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door/staircase was the proper one to get inside. \nOnce inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD! \nMy brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. \nWe ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the Smith Lemonade) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards. \nAs I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the curried carrot soup, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a Georgian Bay whitefish, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The pork chops were also raved about. There was also a risotto, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater. \nThe desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just chocolate ice cream, nothing special. The lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. \nI think everyone left feeling really satisfied. \nIt did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice.\nBasically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom. Also, the hand dryers were weak/not working. \nThat said, I wouldn't let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here! This is a nice, little place!","cefRDEK5O3t_iUuwnmL27Q","4","2012-07-12","1","1"

We went in and looked at the selection and decided what we wanted and when the person behind the counter asked to take our order and we said we wanted to sit down. He wouldn't take the order and instead had us sit down and look at menus. We explained we knew what we wanted already, but he said he'd be back in a minute. This was fine, we weren't in a rush, but we were both a little confused by the ten minutes we sat there waiting for him. \nWhen he finally came out, as we were ordering, his cell phone rang and he took the call and walked away, around the corner of the building.

First of all, I find that this location seems to be sold out of things less often than others. This is an overall problem with the Sephoras in this city - they sell out of things and don't restock often enough. \nOne of Sephora's policies is that if you are, at any time, unhappy or unsatisfied with a product, you can return or exchange it.\nI bought a cream eyeliner from this Sephora several months ago and used about half of it before it decided to dry out (even though I had been keeping the lid on it). I took it back actually because I was hoping there might be some cream or something I could add, that would make it creamy again. \nNo need! They offered to give me a new one, or exchange mine. I chose exchange and they gave me a new brand that they said was excellent AND said they would mention the problem to the sales rep that was coming in for that brand next week. Not that I expect big things to come from that per say, but I'm happy they didn't just blow it off!\nMy only problem with Sephora (all of them) is that you need to make an appointment in advance to get makeup put on and you are required to spend a certain amount of money, while every other makeup seller does this service for free and accommodates walk-ins. I just hear people asking about it a lot and I had a party to go to one night and was downtown and wanted someone to help me touch up my makeup (without doing it myself using samples in the store) and they were very reluctant to help.

I think the burgers here are heads and tails above many other gourmet burger places, mainly because the diversity of toppings. \n\nI like the fries here, but they're nothing special. Same with the poutine, same with the onion rings (I;ve tried em all). But those burgers are good! No word of a lie!\n\nI think the prices are pretty standard for these types of burger places and service has always been fine for me.\n\nThey have a great coke machine...which I know sounds super weird, but you choose your drink...and then can choose the flavour. For example...if I want Fanta, I select that and can then choose any number of Fanta flavours. I always go with a diet cherry coke...where else does that even exist in Canada???! (I'll tell you actually. You can get that at Licks, but they get really confused when you ask for diet coke, instead of regular...they make it themselves). \n\nCriticisms of the small location are valid. This place is very small and cramped. Not nice to eat in...or even to wait. But it is what it is.

Both times I have gone because my normal waxer has been MIA and this place is conveniently close. That said, I find it very expensive, especially for what you get. The first time I went I got the works done...legs, bikini, underarms, etc. The person doing the waxing was very pleasant and kept the conversation going, which I appreciated, but I was still red for DAYS, something I have rarely experienced before in years of waxing. That said, she got the job done. \nToday, however, I had a different girl, who was also very pleasant, but it wasn't until I got home, that I realized what a shoddy job she had done. Patches of hair are still there. I pretty much have to get this redone and I had to pay more to go to this place than any other place I've been to + tip! \nNot only that, but the facility for waxing is pretty pitiful. It's a VERY small room, with the ""bed"" pushed up against a wall. When I went in the summer it was very warm, so I'm not sure if there are A/C or not. The other wall is entirely windows, which of course always have the blinds closed. It's a weirdly appointed room for a waxing area. Perhaps it was originally a storage closet? With windows?? I don't know, but it's not as though you're going here and paying more because the atmosphere is so much nicer!

We were told that they couldn't separate the bill and she brought us one large bill....oh, but SHE couldn't subtract the half price from our apps, because she needed the manager, who wasn't there to do it.

I reserved a table on the Wednesday before and I'm glad I did, but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table. I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us, which was very nice of them, because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats! \n\nI have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there. It is directly on Bloor, but in a small ""mall"" which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses. The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street, so you would never think to just walk into this place...maybe that's the point! \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is really lovely. They have a huge, stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor. The bathrooms are large, individually sectioned off stall, with white and black tiles everywhere and large, vintage, French ads on the walls. \n\nTwo of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu, one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu, which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious. \n\nThey were also offering some Winterlicious cocktails...I had three (the same one) and they were excellent. \n\nOur appetizers included two salads, which looked great and (according to the orderes) were. My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent!\n\nThe main courses included steak from the regular menu, which were ordered with steak frites. The steak was a nice cut of meat, prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good!\n\nThe lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Lasagna came in a rounded dish, where it had been baked and was on the smaller side, but satisfying within a three course meal. My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that. The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice. \n\nI had the pistachio chicken, which was a huge dish! The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken, but in dark meat. Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish. I couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat, but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well! \n\nThe reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious, was because of the dessert. The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer, but the desserts set the prix fixe apart. On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble, or chocolate mousse. Neither of which I really cared for, although I tried it from my husband and it was good. On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which I have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cake. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee, because it was such a lovely, winter dessert. I had been set on the creme brule, but you know what....brules are a dime a dozen. How many places have sticky, toffee cake? \n\nI was NOT disappointed. The cake was amazing! It was a small, singular bundt cake, topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm, caramel. It was decadent and delicious. \n\nFinally I'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way. We all left very happy and satisfied. \n\nThis place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had), but it's great for a nice night out, or a romantic date. \n\nI will definitely come back some time in the future.","kGOr_D-LNpgZ2M9N8TT4QQ","5","2013-01-27","1","1"

Some of the friends has heard that this place KNOWS their wine and ordered a bottle of chianti, which was great (and I'm not a huge wine drinker). \nThe ladies I was with ordered two caesar salads to share amongst the four of them and the waitress brought them out the salads already split on individual plates, garnished with a garlic bread crouton. I don't think the salads were anything special, but I find that caesar salads in general aren't, so peoples' complaints about them below seem largely unfounded. \nI ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer...OMG it was SO good. Goat cheese and grilled veggies on top of a portobello mushroom cap, with some sort of sauce and with salad and shredded carrots and balsamic reduction....to DIE for. \nFor my main I ordered the Penne Gorgonzola, which was also fabulous! The members of my partied ordered the veal parmesan (but grilled veggies instead of the pasta), the salmon with a lobster brandy cream sauce, a NY striploin and fettucine and everyone loved their food. One woman I was with IS a chef, so I feel like that was saying something. \nNow, since I didn't taste their dishes, I can only expand on my own. The sauce was to DIE for. Creamy, complex and delicious. The pairing of veggies with prosciutto and cheese was excellent. I would order that dish again in a heartbeat! \nSince we were having a good time and the food had met our expectations, we went for it and ordered dessert (even though we were all stuffed). We all ordered the white chocolate creme brûlée, except one friend who ordered the tiramisu and were once again not disappointed. Our creme brûlées were crackly on the outside and creamy on the inside. Perfect! The tiramisu was apparently great, served very untraditionally in a large plate, with an indentation like a bowl in the middle. \nI was also pleased to find out that they serve caffeine-free cappuccinos, so we all ordered those as well and it was served with a little almond biscotti and was great!\n\nAltogether my meal came to $50 (tip included), which I think is more than I would spend on a normal dinner out, but not crazy. Also note though that I did not pay for the wine and did not order any other drinks. That would obviously have increased the price. \n\nThe restaurant atmosphere is nothing special, but I'm disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that isn't half as good, so this wasn't a concern for me. The restaurant was clean and comfy, but the furniture was a little on the older side (like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmother's home) and fake paintings on the walls.   \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waitress saw to our every need, answered all our questions and came over to chat and make sure we were happy and comfortable regularly. \n\nSo, was it perfect? Well as I said, the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average, but those did not pose major problems. I would ultimately give this place 4-1/2, but since I can't and this leaned more to the good than anything remotely bad, it gets a 5!

I asked the server if it was processed cheese, or ""real"" cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what I was talking about.

This really should have been a sign and I could probably fault the waiter for this, since you SHOULD know what you're serving, but he was so sweet, I couldn't be mad!\n\nMy husband ordered a hot dog of sorts.\n\nI asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad. There was not, but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway (no charge).

It looked like a five year old did my nails for me. I went home and took the polish off. But this is the kicker:\nI couldn't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by, so I decided to give it a try (obviously the nail girl wouldn't be doing my hair). I went in and sat down the a woman with an Eastern European accent  came to talk with me. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples....none of which looked like my picture, but I always assume the hair dressers know what's best. Now, you're all thinking, ""..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour..."" right? \nNope, she told me she couldn't do my hair because I had lice! Of course I freaked out. Another hair dresser came over to see if I was alright and I was mortified. She asked if I had experienced any itching. I said no. This hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it wasn't too bad yet, but original hairdresser said it was really, really bad. I freaked out and left (obviously without having anything done) and went to a Shoppers and bought lice shampoo. I went home and had my husband look at my hair. He looked and looked and could find nothing. I still didn't want to take chances, so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and I went to a walk-in clinic.

I went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful...but dry at the ends...yeah, because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo! Thanks a lot you crazy woman!\nSo ultimately, I never had lice. I don't know if this woman just decided she didn't feel like doing my hair, or if she was delusional, but I sure won't be going back there EVER again. No one else should either, unless you want to risk being embarrassed and inconvenienced.","DGkjLTH7BiHp_sMgUExYCQ","1","2011-03-26","7","0"

I was in Scarborough Town Centre and came upon this kiosk. It's not a storefront, but a rather ingenious booth, with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes. \n\nThere is a long list of flavours and I suspect (as with many places) they make different cupcakes for different days. \n\nI ordered 6, which was $18...I know, it's steep, that's pretty standard. Cupcake places seem to range from around the $2.25 mark to around $4/cupcake. So these guys fall somewhere inbetween. But not cheap, so I expect excellence, needless to say.\n\nNow, here's the strange thing. On their website each cupcake is listed as $2.90....was this the case at the store?? I sure hope not. Why would you have to pay MORE for buying more? Maybe it's an ordering online thing? Anyway, my GUESS is that you're paying $3/cupcake at the store, or $18 for 6. No real incentive to buy 6. But I did, so moving on....\n\nOf course I chose a range of flavours: oreo cookie. chocolate with vanilla icing, salted caramel, lemon and a double chocolate. \n\nOver two days we managed to work our way through them (myself and my husband) and I nibbled the different flavours. Lemon was my favorite, by far, with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment. It was entirely too salty. More salt than caramel. It wasn't very good at all.\n\nBut that said, none of the cupcakes really blew me away. AND in fact, they were VERY stale the next day, despite being stored in an airtight container, in the fridge. Luckily, the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes, they softened up a bit. \n\nThe bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired. \n\nI was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of Christmas flavours or designed. Right before Christmas you would expect some special flavours...maybe a candy cane, or gingerbread cupcake. It would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a Christmas party dessert. \n\nHaving a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea. Sadly, this business is not one I think I will bother with again!","dSPR-58U95ufvmbvxMpKZg","2","2012-12-21","2","0"

This place had some good reviews and wasn't too far away from us, so off we went.\n\nParking in Leaside can be pretty brutal, but we finally found a space and luckily, street parking is free. \n\nThe restaurant is tacky, stereotypical, but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated. \n\nThe menu has basic Mexican fare, burritos, fajitas, tacos, with your choice of meat. Nothing too outside of the box, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. \n\nWe ordered the guacamole to start and I ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga. \n\nThe guacamole is very delicious and creamy, but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough. We were really loading up the chips with the guacamole! \n\nThe food came out and the was served with rice, a salad (sort of Italian dressing with feta and tomatoes) and refried beans. The salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland, but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice (I'm a wimp). \n\nThe appetizer and our main courses came to $30 and we were VERY full. \n\nService was good and food was good and it wasn't too expensive.

I was running errands and hadn't eaten the whole day, so decided to finally give this place a shot. I ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea.\n\nThe iced tea doesn't appear to be iced tea. It was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice. It was inedible. It was super gross. I was thinking that maybe they made a mistake, but I can't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order, poured the drink and gave it to me SAID it was iced tea. Sooooo ew. \n\nSandwich was alright, but just alright. The ""aroma sauce"" which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good. The bread was good, but the chicken was the sort of cheap, crappy chicken you find at Subway, where it's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat, with fake grill marks on it. It had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich. \n\nThere are soups, salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well, so I'm not writing it off just yet, but this was not a good first impression.","lUstDPzw7aEmnHoR2L_SYw","2","2013-01-03","0","0"

For $15 we got a choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. \n\nWe arrived first and our table was waiting for us. The restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu.\n\nOnce our party finally arrived we all ordered. I had their Chipotle Sweet Potato & Goat Cheese Dip, which was average. The salads looked much better and got better reviews. Same with the soup. The dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle. The dip was good, the pickled cauliflower alright. It was nice when all combined on the crostini (pickled veggies, dip on top of crostini). \n\nI had originally wanted to order the double pork slider, but I saw it arrive at someone else's table and it was literally just the one, single mini pork sandwich, with a few thinly cut fries at the side. It looked good, but it was appetizer size, IF THAT. The chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized, so I ordered that. It was good. I really liked the bread. The macaroni was also more reasonably sized. I sampled it and it was fine. Didn't blow me away. \n\nDessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone I think. Some people ordered the mousse, which I thought was fine, but the people who ordered it loved, so there you have it. My husband loved his apple terrine, which I tried and was good. I liked the flavour of my creme brule very much, but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin, hard candy. It was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth. \n\nThe service was consistently good, so no complaints there. None of us had wine with our lunch (although some had other drinks), so I can't comment there. \n\nThis is a tapas bar, so I expect sizes to be small. BUT when sizes are small I expect them to be priced accordingly and/or to be in sharable portions. They gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually. These would all be hard to share and wouldn't really be worth it. They are nice as a Winterlicious meal, but I'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to.","HxLouUPqiou7D6YK5t-DgQ","3","2013-02-03","1","0"

Especially given how busy and cramped it was. There were no tables, but they got us seats at the bar. The music was maybe a little loud, but I enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening. The place looks like a dive, it's a total hole in the wall, with no signs to speak of, but I liked the weird atmosphere of weird, old ""ghetto blasters"" on the walls and pics of Arnold in Terminator. It's random, just go with it...\nBut the food....OH the FOOD! We were told that the squash poutine was a must have, so I ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak, while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel. The mackerel was served first. It arrived raw, on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it. My friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting, with a delicious marinade. Next came by bulgogi sandwich. Fresh, delicious bread and amazing bulgogi. Was very pleased. Finally the ""poutines"" arrived. I should say that it was not what we were expecting. I assumed it would be squash on top of fries. But in fact the squash was the fries. THey were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce ""gravies"" and scallions and some other stuff that I could neither make out, nor even see clearly (dim lighting). It doesn't matter okay....this stuff was HEAVEN! Both my friend and I took a bite and looked at each other...and proclaimed our new favourite food. \nOther people in our party got the wings, which looked amazing and they said they were and The Loosey, which was also proclaimed as delicious. So basically there were no wrong moves. The drink menu was very adventurous...more so than we were, because we didn't take the plunge, although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them. And splitting the bill for my friend with two others (her birthday), my two ""tapas"" and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $30.

Having never had Ethiopian food before, we were curious, but wary. The deal really helped us dive in. It included two appetizers, four main courses and two desserts. We started with two appetizers, one I wasn't a huge fan of (a ""salad"" with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos, which I found too strong, although other people in my group really liked it). The other appetizer was similar to an Indian samosa (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. \nWe each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter, so we could all share. We ordered two vegetarian options, one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef. Basically, the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera, which are sort of bland, cold, bread-like stuff, which comes rolled up. They're nothing special, but they're only used as a sort of utensil, because you use it to scoop up the food. The food was delicious! I especially liked the chickpea dish. Every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best! Worked out well. I personally found the beef dish very tough though. \nOnce we were stuff with the food, we ordered two desserts. We especially liked the cheesecake (which is obviously not Ethiopian). \nWe asked if they had any Ethiopian coffees and they said yes. THey showed us the beans, as they were being roasted. Then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups. The coffee was so rich, it was almost like chocolate. They also served it with a large basket of popcorn, which was just perfectly prepared. It was such a nice after dinner snack! I would totally come here just to order the coffee! \nIt would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon, so I'm not sure I would make this a regularly destination, but as I said, the coffee was fantastic and it's a fun thing to try, especially with friends.

My only comment would be the washrooms, which feature communal sinks, the kind you find in elementary schools, where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around. Besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands, it's also wasteful if you're the only one there. Strange concept. Throw back, but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch.  \nNow onto the important part...the food and service.\nService started out alright and then immediately got very slow. It took some time to get our drink orders and then took a LONG time to get our actual orders. \nI ordered their French toast, my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger, fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float. I also ordered a side of bacon...and was told that they were out of bacon...which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely, or would be served without bacon. I'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon? Even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous.\nWe also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves. These were delicious.\nApparently my meal was the one that took the longest. The others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out. Who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves?\nMy sister said her tostada was quite good. My French toast was nothing special. The toast was ""fancy"", rounded pieces, on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between. The ""maple"" which was supposed to be on the plate (maple syrup I'm guessing) was barely present. Tasted like something I could have created with some ease.\nMy husband's dish was the best by far. His burger was juicy and this fries were great. The float was a little silly...this big, meaty burger and fries covered in more meat...paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers. (Not insulting, we just got a laugh). \nNothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay. This was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy.\nBecause the brunch itself didn't blow me away, food shortages and service, I'm not sure if I would bother with brunch again.

Apparently it is MY fault they sent the wrong thing, because I sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call...which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something. Which makes zero sense, because two orders were not sent. And the person I was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails I sent with codes to try out....so I have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different. \n\nThey also told me they blocked me on instagram because I was body shaming their models. I want to be VERY clear on this. I never once body shamed, or made any comments on instagram about their models. I asked why they were promoting clothing they don't even have in stock on instagram...apparently that equates to body shaming to them. \n\nThey also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me (3), they were going to start to charge me for shipping. They seemed to forget that I had also been paying to ship items back to them and that I had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders. It's not that they weren't charging me for shipping...it was that I was taking advantage of their own promos. Apparently I can't use their promos anymore, because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now. At least for me. \n\nThey did not address the code not working. \n\nI responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be. \n\nThen I did some research and sent another email. Instead of returning the dress I would donate it to Dress for Success. I said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth. My request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good. I asked that they take the remaining $9.98 credit I had and put it towards them making a small donation, either monetarily or a piece of clothing, also to the charity. I stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to, but if they wouldn't do it for me, perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need. I said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness. \n\nA few hours later I received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to Dress for Success...for the amount of $10 via the store....so my remainder amount I had paid for and Big Sis Closet's contribution of....two cents. Their generosity is astounding. NOW, I don't know that they haven't made their own donation and just not told me of course...I'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard. But given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service, well...I think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject. No further correspondence was sent from the actual store. \n\nBut at any rate, I am donating the new dress to Dress for Success (along with my $9.98) and I am officially done with this store for good. And I sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here. The clothes are not good quality, but more than that...I have NEVER experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life. Zero regard for their customers, zero regard for their own mistakes, zero regard for taking ownership of...anything! Just excuse after excuse and then turning the blame around on their customers. These people do not deserve your business and quite frankly...ladies you deserve better. Better clothing (I have now purchased 6 items and been dissatisfied with the quality of all of them...loose threads, flimsy, cheap fabric, wrong stitching for the fabric, no lining, incorrect fit for size, etc.) and a greater degree of respect as a consumer.","YvuniBBiSs66vx9GtYO2hg","1","2017-02-15","1","0"

Flamenco Saturdays are in the works...""\n\nWhen we were there (on a Saturday) there was a sign out front for a ""dance party"". The lights were down in the back, with a sort of laser light show and early 90s hip hop music was playing. There were about three, older guys there, just hanging out, drinking. It seemed totally out of place. The music didn't match, certainly wasn't flamenco and that's a weird rec room vibe...if that's even something you would want in a restaurant.\n\nI think this place has potential.

My friend ordered the salad and the soup and I ordered the calamari sandwich and soup as the side. The sandwich had some great aioli on it and the calamari was nicely done, however I wasn't a huge fan of the bun it was in.

THat said, the sauces covered the taste from the bread and the texture was good and overall it was tasty.\n\nThe soup I found to have too much black pepper mixed in. The waitress asked and I mentioned and she brought back a small container with grated parmesan cheese and suggested I mix some in, because it cuts the pepper taste. \n\nShe was right!

I'm not sure if this would be my choice if I was JUST looking for dinner out, but not bad if you're feeling lazy, and not wanting to bother going somewhere different for your alcohol and food, like what we were feeling. \n\nThis is a martini bar and so no big surprise, it has a lot of martinis. That said, I shall repeat it...it has a LOT of martinis!! Over 100 different martinis and every one of the ones I tried, I enjoyed. And I tried a good five or something. This may ALSO account for my remembering a good time.\n\nThe service was good too. When I mentioned that I really liked the sauce my pasta came in, the waiter brought me extra sauce in a dish, with bread to dip it in. Weird, but I really enjoyed this...what can I say? I had had like 5-6 martinis! \n\nI would definitely make a trip back again!","JPgBO-7imIPdc2XBkvynpQ","4","2011-03-21","3","2"

My husband called and placed the order and we got a call back saying they had taken down his credit card number incorrectly. Then they called back a few minutes later because they needed directions to our place. \nWe proceeded to get three more calls from a driver asking us where to go. The confusing thing was that he would ask, but then either carry on a conversation on another phone, or with someone who was with him, instead of listening. Then he would ask for my husband to repeat himself. This happened at least twice every call, for three calls. \n\nTurns out they took the address down completely wrong. Big surprise, considering their listening skills. \n\nWe finally got our food and they had screwed up the order and given us a wrong sushi roll. Either way the sushi was among the worst we have tasted. It was a mixture of bland and salty! Basically it was terrible. \n\nOn a side note, their dragon rolls are actually unagi rolls. Dragon rolls are called dragon rolls (at EVERY other sushi place) because they have avocado on top, making them green. It is very strange that these guys have decided that that's not the way they want to go. \n\nSo yeah, terrible service and bad food...you can bet we won't be bothering with this place again EVER!","SN0-O-CuIsyZf3LGZVEUAw","1","2011-11-12","2","0"

"0","nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ","7hTtvuR6fXf7cgFtHBAVCg","This place is a bit of an adventure...at least for me. I've never had charcuterie before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar. \n\nThe four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the charcuterie (sort of a platter of assorted sliced meats and pâté), horse tar tar, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, tongue on brioche and the foie gras and nutella for dessert. \n\nThe dishes came out staggered, so we got to sit around chatting and enjoying ourselves and our cocktails. The charcuterie came out first. It was assorted sliced meats arranged on a wood plank and served with bread. It was actually really nice. Next was the horse tar tar. This was a stretch for me. I don't generally like to eat animals that I LIKE. The people I was with convinced me to try a small bit and I must say, it tasted pretty good, but on principle, I just have trouble with it. Sorry! I hate being one of those people who doesn't have a problem killing the ""ugly"" animals, but doesn't want the cute ones to die...but I am. \n\nNext was the bone marrow, which was....well let's just say I had to keep telling myself not to think about what I was eating. Basically, it's a big bone and the marrow is of course in the middle and has been cooked so that it's almost the consistency of warm butter...pretty fatty and oily looking. You scoop it out with a spoon and put it on bread. It's actually delicious, but feels like you're eating something you shouldn't, purely for health reasons if nothing else! It feels like eating pure fat....tastes as good I suppose. \n\nWe had the tongue on brioche, which I was only okay with. The tongue was sliced and presented as a sort of Montreal smoked meat. We were told to open it up and eat it like an open faced sandwich. This made it easier to split certainly. The meat itself was very tender and the brioche was great, but the meat had a horseradish (I think) sauce, which was a bit overpowering. \n\nFinally we had the tacos, which was probably the more ""normal"" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent. \n\nThe foie gras with nutella was also delicious. It was served on a banana bread, over a nutella spread...but the fois gras was superflous. It didn't add any taste and was overpowered but the nutella and basically didn't add anything to the dish. Could have been served without. Clearly just added to SAY it was there. \n\nSo what's the overall opinion? Well, the restaurant is too small. It's REALLY small, but popular. Wish it was in a bigger location. Sitting at the bar was kind of interesting, because all the cooking was done behind the bar, but that was a small workspace and it got hot, because the oven, dishwasher, stove top and so forth were always turned up very hight. Impressive how they work in such a space though.\n\nOverall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat. \n\nThose are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to! \n\nOh...PS - They don't accept credit cards. Only debit or cash.","pZ1quwXnYozLIZIVABojhw","4","2013-01-13","0","0"

Cafe Polonez was in a great little area, with lots of nice, little shops surrounding it and High Park, of course. \n\nThe restaurant is clean and trendy looking and we took a seat, against the wall, in the back. We ordered the platter for two. Since we had never been, it felt like a good idea to try it ALL out. GREAT idea! We were delivered a platter of food that included two schnitzels, two cabbage rolls, 6 perogies and some other sides. Everything was great, but the schnitzel and cabbage rolls in particular were excellent! I ordered two gravies to go with the schnitzel, expecting two, little Swiss Chalet-sized gravies, but instead we got two, huge bowls of gravy. Needless to say, one bowl would have been more than enough for 2 people. They were only $1 apiece, so not the end of the world. \n\nPlenty of food for two people and a great sampler platter to see what they have and what you like.\n\nService was fast and good and everything was excellent.

Had heard good things, which is why we chose Second City, as opposed to the cheaper Bad Dog Theatre. \n\nI should mention that it was a lot less improv than I expected. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but it was basically, short, individual skits, creating a sort of sketch comedy act, as opposed to improv. This isn't a bad thing. I'm a HUGE fan of SNL, but I was say that I probably laughed more consistently during this performance, than your average episode of SNL. This is because of a combination of personal ""current Toronto"" jokes and because that's the way it should be when you have a couple of months to be putting together your next show, as opposed to one week (as with SNL). I would only expect a more refined show. In addition, we came close to the end of this show's run, so the kinks would presumably be figured out and they told us they were testing some of the new material on us, so that was kind of cool! \n\nThe skits were mostly successful, none failed to make us laugh out loud at least once. There were no weak links in terms of the actors, but the stand outs (for me) were a red headed girl and the black guy....sorry I have no names! I can only go by really obvious characteristics. \n\nWe stuck around after, as they did a little bit of actual improv and another skit, which seemed like an idea they were trying to hash out a little more. Well worth the sticking around even later for!\n\nWhy the lack of one star? Well those pictures down below don't really accurately describe what this place looks like when it's full of people. The chairs are small, there is no coat check and you're all crammed around a very small table. Your coats end up...wherever basically. \n\nProbably because I booked the tickets on the Wednesday before (I'm not sure how they determine seats...it's not first come, first served and it's not on your ticket...that I could see), we originally ended up in a back corner, on high bar stools. My skirt made it so that I kept sliding off the seat! I asked if there was any way we could be moved into regular seats, but the only thing left (and this is how I know seats are prearranged, because there were tonnes of empty seats all around at that time), were right in the front, next to the stage, but to the far side. From this angle, you can't see everything, but we enjoyed it more being right up, near the action. \n\nThat said, it was still VERY crowded and uncomfortable. Tickets are $30 each (here is a tip...it's a little less if you have a CAA membership and order through them), so that's pretty pricey. The show makes it worth it, it truly does. The seating takes away from it. \n\nBUT you can order drinks, which we did and that make just about anything better, so hey! \n\nAt the end of the day, I'll just make sure I wear pants next time and order tickets further in advance and either way it won't stop me from checking out another performance. It's worth a night of non-stop laughter.","DgE8JqFcYgp2SrjSKb3Gsg","4","2013-01-27","0","0"

We went and had our breakfasts, which was served by a rather surely waitress and was average. If this had been our only experience, I would have given three stars, but another night we got in very late and were just looking for a late dinner and found ourselves at this place.\nIt was not very crowded, but was as loud as if three times as many people were there. There was a small group of trashy (very obese people), scream/singing karaoke on a stage in the front of the restaurant. One of them was singing Eminem and the others were screaming and cheering. We sat down in the back, to try and avoid the chaos, but it was way too disruptive. Other people sitting there, who were in the middle of their dinners and therefore stuck there, were looking pained. We didn't bother putting ourselves through this and left. It's a crappy menu, that's overpriced anyway.\nI guess Rock and Rita's name really says it all, but basically if you're not a fall-down, cheap drunk, I don't think you'll have much to say about this place.","2LZGeJy8qByYKB71ML-jcw","2","2012-08-23","2","0"

Well for starters, the gentleman who owns the establishment is lovely and personable. I think their portions are large and the fish to be yummy and not too bland, or overly breaded. I also really like that they make their OWN tartar sauce. So few places seem to do this. You get like 1-2 of those little packets. \nOne star off for having to buy the tartar sauce separately, and for it being rather small portions. I KNOW tartar sauce is not that premium of an item...why does no one include it in the price, or at least give a nice, proper portion?

Overall, our experience was fine and I would probably try it again, but I won't be rushing back. We called to make reservations. I asked for 7 or 7:30 and was told that 7:30 ""would be better"". Assuming that meant 7 was a busy time, we went to the area and were prepared to wander around for a bit...but the restaurant was almost empty, so we went in and were seated promptly. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly and took our orders. I had the mussels and my husband had the salad. Both were good, although the mussels were quite spicy, something I wish was specified before ordering. \n\nMy husband ordered the pork hock and I had the pasta. His dish was prepared very well and the meat very tender and nice. My pasta however was very bland. the pasta noodles were overcooked and fell apart easily, making it hard to twist in my fork. The limited sauce had little flavour. The chicken and mushrooms in the pasta were the best part, but it wasn't enough to make me consider this a ""good"" dish. More like something I would make for myself at home and be only mildly satisfied. \n\nWhen the server gave us our bill, she took away my husband's beer that he was not finished with. We didn't notice until it was too late. \n\nAll this said, I saw other dishes that looked pretty amazing, my husband's food was much better than mine, and despite the beer stealing, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere made for a nice date spot. \n\nIt's not cheap though, coming to $77 for the two apps, two drinks and two mains. So I was hoping for a little better. I hope if I try this place again it will please me a little more.","MZ4EEf4VtkeSJURIGgp2AQ","3","2015-09-26","1","0"

So I decided that I wanted to have my birthday dessert there. I called up to make a reservation for about 10 people. I was informed that for groups of over ten, there is a requirement that every person spends $48! \n\nI kept the reservation for a day to see how many people were actually going to confirm coming out, but since everyone confirmed, I had to call back and cancel my reservation, because I do not want my guests to be obliged to spend $50 on dessert, after we have already had dinner! The girl on the phone said that it usually worked out, because once people had dessert and a drink, it worked out to be enough. As I said below, let's round up and say dessert is $20...so she's saying their drinks are $28!??! \n\nI have wanted to go to Moroco for my birthday since the summer, but that was before I realized how pretentious they are! No thanks! Chocolate is great there, but only go with a couple of people, otherwise you'll have to pay the price!\n\n* * * * *\n\n(Original reviews: Oh my gosh, this place is to DIE for. It's also crazy expensive! This isn't a ""daily treat during the work day"" place, it's a ""I'm celebrating something and want a very special treat"" place. Deserts are around the $18/person range.\n\nThat said, the atmosphere was amazing. The place is all in black and white and looks/feels very trendy. The desserts though....WOW. Amazing! Chocolate fondue that is heavenly! \n\nAnyway, I've decided that this is where I want to go for my birthday dinner. Forget conventional dinner.

The food is good and the atmosphere is good, but it's quite expensive for what you get (especially for drinks) and I found that the service was mediocre. \n\nWe had quite a large group, so we got a variety of pizzas and split them. This was tricky because the pizzas were all divided into four pieces each. Even though we said we were splitting them all, no one seemed to think to split them up a bit more. \n\nThey were also quite slow with the service, especially taking our order initially. \n\nBut, as I said, the pizzas we ordered were very good. Some stranger combinations were a big hit, like the pear pizza, which worked a bit like a dessert. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice, I especially like the basement. So overall if you're looking for a nice night out, I would go for it.

The chicken was a huge portion, on a full waffle. The waffle was the perfect blend of sweetness, with just a bit of syrup and the chicken was crispy and great and so tender it just flaked apart. It had a great sauce on top and the slight kick, blended with the sweetness of the waffle, was a great mix. Portion size was good, food was delicious. Came with a little cup of potato salad...liked the peas, nice touch and the potato salad was a refreshing touch for the whole dish.

So we made reservations at O. Noir. Overall, it was a good time and a good laugh. \n\nOne recommendation: Maybe don't wear your BEST clothes to this place, as there is a very really possibility that you will drop food on yourself. \n\nTHE WAY IT WORKS: For those of you who don't know - You enter into a lounge with brick walls and dim lights. You pre-order your meal and can order drinks from the bar there. THen you are introduced to your waiter(ess), who is visually impaired, and are led into a pitch black room and seated at your table. \n\nAnd it IS pitch black. You can't see your hand in front of your face. Your eyes never adjust and there is a sort of entrance way into the room, so you never even get light from the door when someone enters the room. \n\nYou are then served your food and have to go about the task of trying to eat it, while blind. This is a challenge, because you can't see the food and because even when you THINK you've finally speared a veggie, for example, when you bring the fork to your mouth, you realized you've lost it somewhere along the way. Usually into your lap. \n\nThis is DEFINITELY an experience, does an interesting job at raising awareness, but here are my issues with this place: The food was good, but not great. This becomes more apparent when you can't even see the presentation of the food and are reliant entirely on taste. It needs to taste GREAT. This was distinctly forgettable food. \n\nI would have liked to see the room we were in at the end of the meal. YES, I know this would require everyone eating at the same time, no new people entering, but I was a little sketched out about never seeing where I was. Basically, you could be in dirty, dank basement storage room and you'd never know! \n\nFinally, it's very expensive! \n\nI found that I liked it to try once and say I've done it, but it's gimmicky and that doesn't translate well into a place that will become a go-to favorite. Once is enough for me!","uF86ZhygpBEGr3CudNemYA","3","2011-11-20","2","0"

But let's focus on Toronto bagels. \n\nSeveral months ago I had a hankering for bagels. I decided to give What a Bagel a try and was pleased with their prices (exactly $6 for a dozen bagels) and the taste. They were really, very good! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a variety of flavours to choose from. \n\nBut I had this nagging feeling, because it wasn't a ""traditional Jewish bagel shop"". I swore I wouldn't give a full judgement until I had sampled bagels from Bagel World. Bagel World, which has a few locations in the city, boosts the best bagels IN the city. They also have weird hours though, making it hard to get to on a weeknight.\n\nI finally made it there and grabbed four bagels. My husband and I eagerly sampled the first two...and were VERY disappointed. (See full review under Bagel World). \n\nSOOO What a Bagel wins!

"1","nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ","MAxkkTNwUpnjoZ4wiWGwAg","We were in the area and absolutely starving and I had a craving for pub fare, so this seemed to fit the bill, especially because it's had a few good reviews, but I found it only so-so. \n\nDecor: Another reviewer mentions that the decor seems to be missing something and I agree. It's boring. The booths had gaps where the seat meets with the wooden bench part that holds the seat part up. Hard to describe, but looks cheap and crappy, like they're broken. Our table was very unbalanced and the waitress came and stuck a coaster under it so it would stop rocking. It's small and very cramped. \n\nFood: Selection was pretty standard pub fare, but a bit on the expensive side. I ordered a chicken curry dish and when they asked if I wanted it to be spicy or mild I asked for it to be mild. Either their mild is just VERY spicy and I would hate to try their actual spicy, or they made a mistake. The curry comes with the chicken in sauce, rice and a sort of fried crisp, which was nice. The rice was bland however...or the spice from the curry killed my tastebuds. \nMy husband chose a burger, which was overall very good, although they charged him two dollars each for bacon and cheese on the burger, which is expensive when your burger is already $15. Not sure the bacon added anything, but the cheese, I'll admit was really good on this burger. \n\nAtmosphere and Service: Service was fine. BUT, since this seems to be a trend...or the gods are intent on making me detest children while eating out, we had another loud, rude child/negligent parent situation (see post on Malaysian place). Another situation where children were screaming and running around and parents were sitting off, by themselves, ignoring them, while the rest of the people in the restaurant had to suffer. The group of older individuals across from us kept leaning over to make comments to us and the two ladies nearby grumbled under their breath. \n\nOnce again, this was a problem that could easily have been solved by the restaurant. The kids were part of a party and were in a party room, which is adjacent, but separate from the rest of the dining room. This room had doors on it...which CLOSE, but were propped wide open. All the waitress had to do was go and quietly shut the doors. That's it! Problem solved. \n\nWe were getting annoyed and so we didn't bother ordering dessert. Too bad, because they actually looked great. The group across from us ordered a few and were commenting on how good they were.\n\nSo yeah...I actually would have given this pub 2 stars even without the screaming kid, but if the screaming kid had not been a problem, we probably would have stayed for dessert and who knows, maybe these guys would be getting 3+ stars. That said, it just didn't do it for me. Overpriced, for only okay food and poor atmosphere.","HZ1nss1kZrSMLSRQEo2vkQ","2","2012-04-15","2","0"
"3","nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ","VuN5MT-_Joud-2NnzY6cSg","I am just perplexed by the good reviews of this place. Granted there are only 4 as I am writing this, but still they seemed pretty consistent. \n\nWe have driven by this place a million times and never given it a second glance, but based on the reviews, off we went to give it a try.\n\nFirst impressions were pretty good. We were seated right away in a large booth. The restaurant was clean and modern looking, although covered in Halloween decorations, despite it being November 10. \n\nMenu looked pretty good, with lots of selection. The front of the menu is the desserts, which seem to be why most people come here. But we wanted dinner as well. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup and my husband ordered chicken and mushrooms with rice. \n\nWe both ordered drinks. I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a mango smoothie. \n\nMy drink came out...then my soup came out...neither of my husbands orders came. It took another fifteen minutes for his food to come and his drink came after that! No apologies for the wait. \n\nMy soup was pretty basic. The noodles had no taste and a sticky texture. It was bland overall, but not terrible. My drink was good, but small, given the $6 price tag for a tea. \n\nMy husbands dish was just gross. The chicken were little balls that looked like chicken fetuses. Maybe they were?? Filled with bones, making them very difficult to eat. The taste was bland and salty. \n\nHis drink was good, but the straw didn't reach to the bottom of the glass...which wasn't a glass at all, but a wine decanter. He couldn't reach his drink about half-way through and had to borrow my straw.\n\nWe finished our meals and started waiting...and waiting and waiting. No one had come to check and see how our meals were and we had to flag someone down to clear the dishes. A girl finally came to go it and did so without looking, or asking if there was anything else she could get for us, or if we wanted refills. \n\nWe REALLY wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided to stick it out and order dessert, since it seemed to be what this place was all about. \n\nWe flagged someone down and ordered mixed fruit on a waffle. The presentation of the dish was certainly nice, but it's pretty generic. It's a basic belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and some melon balls and cool whip whipped cream on top and a sort of Aunt Jemima syrup. \n\nIt was pretty good, but nothing special.\n\nOnce we finished we flagged someone down to get our bill. He said yes and left...and never came back. We saw his give other people bills and get food...he basically completely forgot about us. We waited for 15 minutes. We started looking around to figure out what happened and noticed that the wait staff were just chilling in the back of the restaurant. One girl was staring aimlessly at the ceiling. Two others were holding hands and swinging their arms in time to the music. Two guys were back there chatting away...it was actually weird. \n\nFinally, we managed to flag down yet a DIFFERENT waitress...this was number 6 (one seated us, one took our order, one cleared the dishes, one took the dessert order and one went to get our bill...apparently, and now this one) and asked her to get our bill. She finally did. We paid...we left a tip (we try hard not be be jerks, even if the service is poor) and left...never to return. \n\nSo yeah, bland food, generic desserts and TERRIBLE service = not worth it. \n\nOne another note, another review says, ""If you're into young asian girls (and guys), this is the place to hang out."" I KNOW this person meant nothing by this comment, but I swear there is some creepy dude who has done a Google search of ""Places where young Asian girls and boys hang out"" and found this place based on that review...so you know...probably some creepers hanging around as well.

Since I have been several times and never had a bad experience, I can only give my review of this place based on what I have experienced. \n\nThat said, it seems like so many people have experienced bad service, that even I am wary of this place now. I have never been during ""peak"" hours, which may account for more attentive service.\n\nAs mentioned, I have been to this restaurant several times and really enjoyed myself. I love Mexican food and there doesn't seem to be enough good Mexican restaurants around, so I get excited when I find one with food I enjoy.\n\nI have had their nachos, two types of tacos and a burrito at this place and enjoyed all of them. When I went with a girlfriend, we were advised to get two taco plates and share them, since they give you a few, small tacos on each plate. We did this and really enjoyed both dishes. \n\nThe nachos were also great, having been piled high with toppings, not just your grated cheese and some tomatoes. \n\nDrinks were also good. I guess my one criticism would be the price, which I do think is a little high given that Mexican food is quite cheap to produce. I am guessing that the extra cost goes towards the atmosphere, which is trendy...but I gave this same review to another Mexican restaurant I went to in Florida and it looked like someone's kitchen, so I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder.","RWYQMss0RzbtDGGwRI3iaQ","4","2011-03-21","2","2"

I lay in a hammock (I was in Sail, what else would I do?) I researched places to get sandwiches in the area and this place came up and had good reviews. I mentioned to my husband as we were checking out and the check out guy said, ""There is this good place nearby named Ricci's."" That sealed the deal. Off we went.\n\nThe outside is hardly something to look at. The sign is faded and dirty and it looks, outside, like it's a dive. We went in a saw a modestly busy place, clean and a HUGE menu. You can eat in (seating is limited and similar to fast food seating), can get delivery, or get take out. \n\nThe menu is extensive, with pasta, pizza and panzerotti. We went with what many people were raving about online and got panzerotti...fried ones. OH GOD HEART ATTACK.

You'd think a place like this would be packed.\n\nThe service is what really made this place great for me. I would rate this place in the top two or three restaurants I've ever eaten in as far as service goes.\n\nThe food was good to. Everyone in my party  of 6 enjoyed their meals. I personally would rate my steak a 4 out of 5. But with the kind of service you get here I didn't mind.\n\nThe total bill came to 274 and change for a party of 6. That includes one bottle of wine and a couple of other mixed drinks.

A quick Yelp review showed this place was on my way home.\n\nIt's a small place in a business district. The young tatted girl working the counter was polite and helpful.\n\nAfter perusing their menu I decided to order a full slab of beef ribs, a order of mac and cheese and two orders of coleslaw. With a tip it came to $53\n\nI wanted to get a bottle of soda to go but they don't sell it by the bottle and I didn't want to spill it in my car on the way home. So I passed on the soda.\n\nWe found the entire meal to be okay. The ribs were very pink in the middle. I suppose some like it that way. But they were much more pink than we prefer.\n\nNeither of us liked the mac and cheese. We found the macaronis to be way over cooked. We prefer them to have a little bit of firmness.\n\nThe cole slaw was the best part of the meal, although it was a bit dry. If there was a little slaw juice in with it it would be great!\n\nSo would I stop here again. Perhaps, but I think I'd try something different. \n\nAnd bottles or cans of soda would be great so you wouldn't have to stop somewhere else.","ngs16C2M_uTq2zXamltHVw","3","2017-05-28","3","0"

Definitely not the best dining experience we've ever had.\n\nFirst of all the young girl taking our order seemed very bored with her job.

When they didn't I assumed our drink cups would be brought to us at the table. They weren't. We went back up to the counter to get our cups.\n\nThere was some smell emanating from the restroom that smelled like spoiled air freshener if there is such a thing. My girlfriend said it was almost overpowering in the restroom. It was a really sickly sweet smell. I'm not sure what it was but it didn't make the burgers taste any better.\n\nHere it is several hours later and I'm a little bit queasy. Not sure if it was the burger, but I haven't eaten anything else today. \n\nIf it comes back up I'll change my review to a 1 for now I'll stick with my 2 star review.","5jTmjxb1X34EfcY1gos4tw","2","2017-03-20","2","0"

I ordered the club sandwich, My girl ordered a gyro. Both meals came some sort of a thick chicken rice soup with a lemon taste. The soup was good until my girl discovered a hair in hers.

It has a romantic, intimate feel.  The food is delicious, and the drinks are fantastic.  I came here yesterday to meet someone, and a friend of mine - Dominique - was bartending.  Others have commented on her ability to make incredible drinks, and I will add on to those positive comments!  Whether you ask for something on the menu, or something not on the menu, it will be one of the best drinks you get in all of Vegas.  I've lived here a little while, and I can testify!

When we arrived, I got my fresh, beautiful, red rose (all ladies who come here receive one), and were seated immediately.  We had a few different servers attend to us - one for wines, one for our salad, and another for the rest of our needs.  I was blown away by the romantic setting, incredible service, and the impressive food!  As a vegetarian, your options are limited here, but never fear!  I had the vegetarian entree, which changes by the day.  When we went, it was mushroom ravioli, and oh wow.  It was SO good!  They were out of the raspberry cheesecake when we got to dessert, so we chose the berry tarte instead... I'm glad they were out of the cheesecake, because we wouldn't have gotten to try it otherwise!  (There are no words for how good it was.)  Everything about this experience was extremely positive.

I'm a vegetarian, and they let me swap out the meat that was on the menu for a side dish, so I was able to make my meal even more healthy.

And with plenty of options (I'm vegetarian), there's a lot of tasty options to choose from.  They'll also let you sample something if you've never tried it.  I recently moved here from the Midwest, and had never eat cactus before.  (Turns out it's yummy!)  I had two burritos, and they were very good.\n\nCons: the food is given in very small portions.  Usually I don't complain about this because I'm a small person, and huge portions are usually a waste (or a doggie bag).  But I also have a healthy appetite, and found that one burrito was not enough.  So, if you've never been here, be on the safe side and order two of whatever you're thinking of ordering.  The tacos are even smaller, so maybe three.  And I'm talking about a normal person who's feeling an average hunger level.  If you're starving, please go elsewhere (haha).\n\nAll that being said, it's definitely worth going to.  This is Mexican food, made by people from Mexico - i.e., the way Mexican food Should be.  It's authentic.  If you're visiting Vegas, don't go to Taco Bell.  Please don't go to Taco Bell.  Go to Taco Y Taco, instead.","TCoBE_BkDRrK0bWrh5VueQ","4","2016-03-14","1","0"

I actually liked it more than the wrap that I had (which was definitely tasty!).  Seriously.  You have to go and try it for yourself.  It's a hidden gem.  You can easily miss it, even looking for it, as my date and I did.  The service is also good.  The people who work there are really nice, so that's of course part of the five star rating.  It's Mediterranean, so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty, but I won't let it go unsaid.  Please, just do yourself a favor.  Go here and try it out yourself.

First of all, the waiting place is too small for all the people it struggles to accommodate, so you might get claustrophobic.  Also, though I know this isn't unique to this specific venue, not allowing someone to carry in their own water bottle - and then charging $5 for an average-sized water bottle - is ridiculous.

I have to admit, the security guards on the way out always make me feel a little uneasy.  I do understand what other reviewers have said about profiling, as I am a white, middle-class woman, and am hardly ever asked for my receipt.  BUT, most of the time, I use the self-checkouts, and the guards can probably see me conducting my checkout process, so that's probably also a factor.\n\nIn any case, it's pretty much your usual WMS.  I don't feel there's anything extra special about it.  I tend to go to the Neighborhood Market on Silverado because the workers are much more friendly and upbeat there.  I don't Expect niceness - I mean, after all, the pay is crap and I don't think they get any benefits.  I'd probably hate working there, too.  But, it's nice to find it when I can.  That being said, I've met plenty of nice and helpful workers at this branch, as well.  If you're looking for great organic produce, great produce in general, or specialty items, it's best to shop at Smith's or Sprouts.

Part of that is because you are in Las Vegas, but at those price points I expect more.\n\nFor my meal I ordered the Cedar River Filet Mignon.  The filet comes with a red wine jus.  The filet was solid.  It was prepared as ordered.  The problem is I was expecting a $54 filet, and got a $35-$40 filet.  I had hoped for better flavor and texture.  It was by no means bad, it just did not live up to expectations.\n\nFor a side I chose the Old Bay Fries with remoulade.  The fries were ok.  The remoulade had good flavor.  Once again, for the price you want and expect more.\n\nOverall this is a solid place.  My review will not help most as I did not eat any of the seafood options.

I make several trips to Las Vegas a year for work and I have stayed at many of the other casinos.  I had heard from many people that it was by far the best in Las Vegas.\n\nIt is not the best, but it is pretty good.  The guest rooms are large.  They are laid out quite well.  My room gave me a great view down the strip.  The floor to ceiling windows is a nice touch.  The rooms are nicely appointed through out.\n\nThe bathrooms are large.  I always enjoy the small flat screen television in the bathroom.  Several hotels do this now, but the television in my bathroom was loud enough for me to hear it while showering.  That simple fact made me happy.\n\nThe reason I did not give the Wynn five stars is the choice of patterns and colors.  I find them quite tacky.  I know I am in the minority in this, but I find the decor at the Venetian & Palazzo quite nicer.  The carpet in the hallways is brutal.\n\nI am not a gambler so I can not say much to that.  There are several great food options.  Parking is easy.  I found a spot quickly and had a short walk to the guest room elevators.\n\nI have many friends that always go the cheap route and stay at scary places like Excalibur and Luxor.  Trust me on this.  Spend the extra money and stay at a good hotel/casino.  There are many to choose from.  Treat yourself to the Wynn, Venetian or Bellagio at least once.
